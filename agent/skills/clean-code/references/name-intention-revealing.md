## Use Intention-Revealing Names

Names should reveal intent. A name should tell you why something exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, it does not reveal its intent.

**Incorrect (requires mental decoding):**

```java
int d; // elapsed time in days

public List<int[]> getThem() {
    List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int[] x : theList)
        if (x[0] == 4)  // What is 4? What is x[0]?
            list1.add(x);
    return list1;
}
```

**Correct (self-documenting):**

```java
int elapsedTimeInDays;

public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
    List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
        if (cell.isFlagged())
            flaggedCells.add(cell);
    return flaggedCells;
}
```

The code now explicitly communicates its purpose: finding flagged cells in a minesweeper game. No comment needed.

**When short names are acceptable:**
- Loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`) in small, tightly-scoped loops where the index has no domain meaning.
- Mathematical algorithms where `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dt` are conventional and understood by the target audience.
- Lambda parameters in trivial callbacks: `items.filter(x -> x > 0)` is clearer than `items.filter(numberThatMustBePositive -> numberThatMustBePositive > 0)`.
