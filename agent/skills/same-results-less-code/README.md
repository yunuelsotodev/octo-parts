# Same Results, Less Code

A code-review and refactoring skill focused on the parts of code volume that come from **judgment and modelling gaps** — the things a senior reviewer notices that linters can't. Contains 40 rules across 8 categories.

## Overview

This skill targets the *second-pass* refactoring work: what remains after `knip`, `eslint`, `ruff`, `tsc --noUnusedLocals`, and formatters have done their job. It is deliberately **not** a clone of those tools — every rule here requires *judgment* about intent, modelling, or framing.

Core principles:

- **Preserve behaviour.** Every transformation must produce identical observable behaviour.
- **Earlier mistakes cascade.** Wrong frame multiplies into wrong shapes, which multiply into duplicate logic.
- **Explain why, not just what.** Each rule explains the cost of the anti-pattern so the model can transfer the judgment to novel cases.
- **Don't over-refactor.** Rule of three: extract abstractions when duplication has actually appeared three times, not in anticipation.

## Getting Started

```bash
# No installation required — this is a documentation-only skill.
# For development/validation:
pnpm install   # Install validation dependencies (optional)
pnpm build     # Build/compile AGENTS.md from source rules
pnpm validate  # Validate skill structure and content
```

1. Read `SKILL.md` for an overview and quick reference.
2. Check `references/_sections.md` to understand category priorities.
3. Reference individual rules as needed during code review or refactoring.

## Creating a New Rule

1. Confirm the rule **isn't** something a linter already catches (`knip`, `eslint`, `ruff`, `tsc`). If a linter handles it, the rule belongs in a different skill (e.g. `code-simplifier`).
2. Confirm the fix requires *judgment* about intent, modelling, or framing — not just pattern matching.
3. Copy `assets/templates/_template.md` to `references/{prefix}-{slug}.md`.
4. Fill in frontmatter: `title`, `impact`, `impactDescription`, `tags`.
5. Write the WHY explanation (1-3 sentences explaining the cost of the anti-pattern).
6. Add `Incorrect` and `Correct` code examples (production-realistic, minimal-diff).
7. Add a `When NOT to use this pattern` section — every rule has a legitimate exception.
8. Update `SKILL.md`'s quick reference section.
9. Rebuild `AGENTS.md`: `node .../build-agents-md.js .`

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file follows this format:

```markdown
---
title: Rule Title
impact: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM-HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW-MEDIUM|LOW
impactDescription: Quantified impact (e.g., "reduces 50-200 lines of branches to a small table")
tags: prefix, technique, related-concepts
---

## Rule Title

WHY this matters (1-3 sentences explaining the cost of the anti-pattern).

**Incorrect (what's wrong):**
\`\`\`typescript
Bad example
\`\`\`

**Correct (what's right):**
\`\`\`typescript
Good example - minimal diff from incorrect
\`\`\`

**When NOT to use this pattern:**

- Exception 1 with reason
- Exception 2 with reason

```

## File Naming Convention

- Prefix must match category: `reinvent-`, `frame-`, `dup-`, `derive-`, `proc-`, `spec-`, `defense-`, `types-`
- Slug should be descriptive: `function-not-class`, `parallel-types-same-shape`, `dont-store-computed`
- Examples: `frame-function-not-class.md`, `dup-near-twin-functions.md`, `defense-let-it-throw.md`

## Impact Levels

| Level | Description | Used For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| CRITICAL | Cascades into many downstream costs; large maintenance impact | Reinvention, Wrong Frame |
| HIGH | Affects significant parts of the codebase; common refactor target | Hidden Duplication, Derived State |
| MEDIUM-HIGH | Localised but high frequency; clear refactor wins | Procedural Rebuilds |
| MEDIUM | Common but contained; judgment-dependent | Speculative Generality, Defensive Excess |
| LOW-MEDIUM | Specific to type-system-aware languages; ergonomics-focused | Type System Underuse |
| LOW | Edge cases, expert patterns | (none in this skill) |

## Scripts

Validate the skill structure and content:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/dot-claude/dev-skill/*/scripts/validate-skill.js ./same-results-less-code
```

Rebuild AGENTS.md after adding or modifying rules (never edit AGENTS.md manually):

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/dot-claude/dev-skill/*/scripts/build-agents-md.js ./same-results-less-code
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the rule template exactly.
2. Ensure the first tag matches the file prefix.
3. Use production-realistic code examples (no `foo`/`bar`/`baz`).
4. Make the `Incorrect` → `Correct` diff minimal — preserve variable names and structure where possible.
5. Quantify impact: prefer "eliminates N lines / prevents X bug class" over "cleaner."
6. Include a `When NOT to use this pattern` section. Every rule has a legitimate exception, and naming it is what turns a rigid rule into transferable judgment.
7. Run validation before submitting.
