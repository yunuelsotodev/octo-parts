React Refactor Best Practices  
May 2026

## Abstract

Architectural refactoring guide for React applications. Contains 40 rules across 7 categories covering component architecture, state architecture, hook patterns, component decomposition, coupling and cohesion, data and side effects, and refactoring safety. Each rule includes code smell indicators, before/after transforms, and safe refactoring steps.

## Table of Contents

1. [Component Architecture](references/_sections.md#1-component-architecture) — **CRITICAL**

   - 2.5 [Use State Machines for Complex UI Workflows](references/state-machines-for-workflows.md) — CRITICAL (reduces valid states from 2^n to exactly N defined states)
   - 2.6 [Use URL Parameters as State for Shareable Views](references/state-url-as-state.md) — CRITICAL (enables deep linking, back/forward navigation, state sharing)
   - 2.7 [Use useReducer for Multi-Field State Transitions](references/state-reducer-for-complex.md) — CRITICAL (eliminates impossible states, centralizes transition logic)
3. [Hook Patterns](references/_sections.md#3-hook-patterns) — **HIGH**
   - 3.1 [Avoid Object and Array Dependencies in Custom Hooks](references/hook-avoid-object-deps.md) — HIGH (prevents effect re-execution on every render)
   - 3.2 [Compose Hooks Instead of Nesting Them](references/hook-composition-over-nesting.md) — HIGH (flattens dependency graph, eliminates hidden coupling)

   - 3.5 [Keep Custom Hooks to a Single Responsibility](references/hook-single-responsibility.md) — HIGH (3× faster to test, 2× wider reuse)
   - 3.6 [Stabilize Hook Dependencies with Refs and Callbacks](references/hook-dependency-stability.md) — HIGH (prevents infinite loops, eliminates unnecessary re-executions)
4. [Component Decomposition](references/_sections.md#4-component-decomposition) — **HIGH**
   - 4.1 [Apply the Scroll Test to Identify Oversized Components](references/decomp-scroll-test.md) — HIGH (reduces component size to under 100 lines, 3× faster code review)
   - 4.2 [Complete Component Extraction Without Half-Measures](references/decomp-complete-extraction.md) — HIGH (enables independent testing and reuse of extracted component)
   - 4.3 [Extract Components by Independent Change Reasons](references/decomp-extract-by-change-reason.md) — HIGH (70% fewer files touched per feature change)
   - 4.4 [Extract Pure Functions from Component Bodies](references/decomp-extract-pure-functions.md) — HIGH (pure functions testable without React, 10× faster unit tests)
   - 4.5 [Inline Premature Abstractions Before Re-Extracting](references/decomp-inline-premature.md) — HIGH (40-60% simpler code after inlining wrong abstractions)
   - 4.6 [Separate View Layer from Business Logic](references/decomp-separate-view-logic.md) — HIGH (business logic testable without rendering, 5× faster test suite)
5. [Coupling & Cohesion](references/_sections.md#5-coupling-&-cohesion) — **MEDIUM**
   - 5.1 [Break Circular Dependencies with Intermediate Modules](references/couple-break-circular-deps.md) — MEDIUM (eliminates undefined-at-import-time bugs, enables proper tree shaking)
   - 5.2 [Import from Stable Public API Surfaces Only](references/couple-stable-imports.md) — MEDIUM (enables internal refactoring without breaking consumers)
   - 5.3 [Use Barrel-Free Feature Modules for Clean Dependencies](references/couple-barrel-free-features.md) — MEDIUM (200-800ms build time reduction, effective tree shaking)
   - 5.4 [Use Dependency Injection for External Services](references/couple-dependency-injection.md) — MEDIUM (enables testing without mocking modules, 3x faster test setup)
6. [Data & Side Effects](references/_sections.md#6-data-&-side-effects) — **MEDIUM**
   - 6.1 [Fetch Data on the Server by Default](references/data-server-first-fetch.md) — MEDIUM (eliminates client loading spinners, reduces client JS bundle by 30-60%)
   - 6.2 [Place Error Boundaries at Data Fetch Granularity](references/data-granular-error-boundaries.md) — MEDIUM (prevents full-page crash from single component failure)
   - 6.3 [Use Context Module Pattern for Action Colocation](references/data-context-module-pattern.md) — MEDIUM (reduces mutation surface to single file per context)
