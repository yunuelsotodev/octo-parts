## Abstract

Application-level performance optimization guide for React applications. Contains 43 rules across 8 categories covering React Compiler mastery, bundle optimization, rendering performance, data fetching, Core Web Vitals, state subscriptions, profiling, and memory management. Complements the react skill (API-level patterns) with holistic performance strategies.
