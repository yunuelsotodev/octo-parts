description: Opinionated, backend-agnostic Next.js 16 (App Router) architecture — authorization at the data layer, server-side loading with cache()+Promise.all, mutations through next-safe-action + typed route handlers, client/server boundaries ('use client' at leaves + TanStack Query), forms with RHF + Zod, UI via shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Base UI + next-intl, request handling in proxy.ts (Next.js 16's renamed middleware), and a Turbo monorepo of @app/* packages confining the backend behind one data-access package. Examples use Supabase but every rule states the transferable principle. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Next.js 16 code. Trigger on server actions, route handlers, RSC vs 'use client' placement, TanStack Query, RHF/Zod, proxy.ts, or monorepo package layout — even when the user doesn't say 'patterns' or 'best practices'.

# Opinionated Next.js 16 Patterns

Implementation-pattern reference for **Next.js 16 (App Router)** codebases that want a single, opinionated architecture. Contains **50 rules across 8 categories**, prioritised by execution-lifecycle cascade impact — authorization and (optional) tenant modeling first, then the request boundary, server fetching, mutations, client boundaries, architecture, and UI conventions.

The rules are **backend-agnostic in principle but use Supabase as the concrete example**. Each rule teaches the transferable idea (e.g. "authorize at the data layer", "read through a typed repository"); where the backend genuinely matters, a `*Transferable:*` note explains the pattern for other stores (Drizzle, Prisma). The structure is a **Turbo monorepo** with `@app/*` packages you own — built on canonical libraries (`next-safe-action`, `@supabase/ssr`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-hook-form` + `zod`, `shadcn/ui`, `next-intl`, `pino`), not a vendored starter kit.

## When to Apply

Reach for these rules when:

- **Writing new code** — pages, layouts, server actions, route handlers, `proxy.ts`, feature packages, client components, hooks, the data-access package, SQL/migrations, forms.
- **Reviewing a PR** — authorization slips (privileged client without a guard, missing `'server-only'`), waterfalls (sequential awaits, client-fetching server data), drift (hand-edited generated types, deep package imports, hardcoded i18n strings).
- **Refactoring** — moving code between `apps/web` and `packages/*`, splitting actions and services, lifting `'use client'` boundaries, replacing raw queries with a typed data-access factory, swapping a backend behind the data-access package.
- **Designing a feature** — choosing the right client (request-scoped vs privileged vs browser), deciding action vs route handler, planning the form/server-action contract, scoping a tenant (if multi-tenant).
- **Onboarding** — understanding *why* the codebase looks the way it does, with concrete, transferable examples.
