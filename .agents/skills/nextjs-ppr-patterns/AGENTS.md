## Abstract

Partial Prerendering (PPR) patterns for the Next.js 16 App Router under the Cache Components model, from the simplest static-shell-plus-one-hole page to forms and multi-step wizards. Corrects the wrong defaults of a model trained on Next.js 14/15: the removed experimental.ppr flags, implicit caching, Suspense as the static/dynamic boundary, the 'use cache' directive and its constraints, async runtime APIs, server-to-client Promise streaming with use(), and read-your-writes mutations with updateTag. Includes an empirical boundary-debugging playbook that deconstructs what actually rendered static vs dynamic by diffing the static shell against the hydrated DOM, using next build signals and chrome-devtools-mcp driven via mcporter.
