## Use the task modifier for view-lifetime async work, not Task inside onAppear

The wrong default is `.onAppear { Task { await fetch() } }` — a manually created task starts a unit of work SwiftUI cannot manage, so the framework cannot cancel it when the user navigates away before the load completes. A view that is added and removed repeatedly stacks redundant background tasks that keep consuming memory and CPU after the user has moved on. The `.task` modifier ties the same work to the view's presence in the hierarchy: if the view is removed before the work finishes, SwiftUI cancels the task automatically, and the async closure is already a managed async context so no manual `Task` block is needed.

**Evidence of violation:** a `Task { }` created inside `.onAppear` (or another appearance-driven entry point) whose awaited result populates this view's state. A `Task { }` inside `.onChange` is out of scope here — `task-id-for-async-state-reactions` owns change-driven work. PASS: the same work expressed as `.task { await … }` or `.task(id:)`. Synchronous, lightweight work inside `.onAppear` — property assignments, run-once guards — is endorsed by the source and never fails this rule. N/A: the spawned work is deliberately view-independent (must outlive the view) AND a comment on the `Task` says so — absent that comment, fail closed. N/A on deployment targets below iOS 15 / macOS 12, where `.task` is unavailable.

**Incorrect (task survives the view and stacks on reappearance):**

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Bird: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
}

enum BirdDataService {
    static func fetchBirds() async -> [Bird] { [] }
}

struct BirdListView: View {
    @State private var birds: [Bird] = []

    var body: some View {
        List(birds) { bird in
            Text(bird.name)
        }
        .onAppear {
            // ⚠️ This task won't be automatically cancelled
            Task {
                birds = await BirdDataService.fetchBirds()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Correct (SwiftUI cancels the work when the view leaves the hierarchy):**

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Bird: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
}

enum BirdDataService {
    static func fetchBirds() async -> [Bird] { [] }
}

struct BirdListView: View {
    @State private var birds: [Bird] = []

    var body: some View {
        List(birds) { bird in
            Text(bird.name)
        }
        .overlay {
            if birds.isEmpty {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .task {
            birds = await BirdDataService.fetchBirds()
        }
    }
}
```
