name: acceptance-pipeline-feature-design
description: Designs new features, extensions, or modifications to Uncle Bob's Acceptance Pipeline Specification — new mutation strategies, Gherkin syntax support, report formats, pipeline stages, IR fields, or handler patterns. Trigger when someone asks "how would I add X to the acceptance pipeline" or discusses spec-level changes to the parser, generator, runtime, mutator, or reporter components — even if they don't explicitly say "feature design." Works in tandem with the acceptance-pipeline-catalog skill, which provides the baseline spec reference.

# Acceptance Pipeline Feature Design

Guides agents through designing new features that extend Uncle Bob's Acceptance Pipeline Specification. Produces spec-quality output — language-neutral, implementation-agnostic, with precise behavioral requirements — that matches the style and rigor of the original spec.

This is a composition skill. It does not catalog what exists (that is `acceptance-pipeline-catalog`'s job). Instead, it provides a structured workflow for designing what comes next.

## When to Apply

- Designing a new mutation strategy, value type, or filter mechanism for the mutator
- Adding new Gherkin syntax support (data tables, tags, Rules keyword) to the parser
- Extending the JSON IR with new fields or objects
- Creating new report formats (HTML, JUnit XML) or output channels
- Adding new pipeline stages or operating modes (parallel runs, coverage filtering)
- Any spec-level change that affects multiple pipeline components (cross-cutting)

## Prerequisite

Before using this skill, ensure `acceptance-pipeline-catalog` is available. That skill provides the baseline reference for the 9 required components, JSON IR schema, conformance checklist (21 items), and agent setup checklist (15 steps). This skill builds on top of that foundation.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow has five phases, executed in order. Each phase builds on the output of the previous one — skipping phases produces incomplete or inconsistent designs.

```
Phase 1: Survey Existing Spec     → Know what exists before proposing changes
Phase 2: Identify Extension Point → Classify where the feature attaches
Phase 3: Draft Feature Spec       → Write the spec section in Uncle Bob's style
Phase 4: Conformance Design       → Add testable conformance items
Phase 5: Impact Analysis          → Assess backward compatibility and migration
```

**Why this order matters:**
- Phase 1 prevents reinventing existing capabilities and ensures the design uses established patterns.
- Phase 2 forces classification before writing — a parser extension has different constraints than a reporter extension.
- Phase 3 produces the actual spec text, informed by the classification from Phase 2.
- Phase 4 ensures the feature is testable from outside the implementation — if you cannot write conformance items, the spec is too vague.
- Phase 5 comes last because you need the complete spec and conformance items to assess impact accurately.

## How to Use

1. Start by reading the `acceptance-pipeline-catalog` skill to understand the current spec
2. Read the phase reference that matches your current workflow step:

| Phase | Reference | When to Read |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | [Survey Existing Spec](references/phase-1-survey.md) | Always — first step for any feature design |
| 2 | [Identify Extension Point](references/phase-2-extension-point.md) | After survey — classify where the feature attaches |
| 3 | [Draft Feature Spec](references/phase-3-draft-spec.md) | After classification — write the spec section |
| 4 | [Conformance Design](references/phase-4-conformance.md) | After drafting — add testable conformance items |
| 5 | [Impact Analysis](references/phase-5-impact-analysis.md) | After conformance — assess compatibility |

3. Consult supporting references as needed:

| Reference | When to Read |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Style Guide](references/style-guide.md) | During Phase 3 — Uncle Bob's spec writing patterns |
| [Extension Catalog](references/extension-catalog.md) | During Phase 2 — ideas and complexity notes for future extensions |

## Extension Point Quick Reference

Features attach to one or more of these 9 components. The JSON IR is the highest-impact extension point because all components consume it.

| Extension Point | What Changes | Impact Level |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Parser | New Gherkin syntax accepted | Medium — affects IR and downstream |
| IR | New fields or objects in JSON interchange | **High** — all consumers affected |
| Generator | New output formats or generation strategies | Low — isolated to generation |
| Runtime | New execution modes, hooks, dispatch | Medium — affects handler contracts |
| Handlers | New matching strategies or contracts | Low-Medium — isolated to step matching |
| Mutator | New mutation strategies or filters | Low — isolated to mutation mode |
| Reporter | New report formats or output channels | Low — isolated to reporting |
| Pipeline | New stages or operating modes | **High** — structural change |
| Cross-cutting | Spans multiple components | **Highest** — requires careful analysis |

## Output

The workflow produces these artifacts:

1. **Feature spec section** — Ready to insert into the Acceptance Pipeline Specification. Written in Uncle Bob's style with purpose paragraph, behavioral requirements, data formats, and examples.
2. **Conformance items** — Numbered, testable items extending the existing 21-item checklist.
3. **Impact analysis table** — Component-by-component assessment of change type, IR effects, breaking changes, and new conformance items.
