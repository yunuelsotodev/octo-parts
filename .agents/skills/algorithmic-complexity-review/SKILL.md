description: Algorithmic complexity (Big-O) review — finding nested loops, N+1 queries, exponential recursion, quadratic string builds, and other accidental complexity blowups. Covers Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, and similar languages. Use whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring code where Big-O matters. Trigger even when the user doesn't mention "Big-O" explicitly — if they're reviewing code for performance, refactoring a hot path, asking "why is this slow," or working with data that scales (loops, recursions, collections, ORM access), apply this skill to classify the time/space complexity and suggest the fix. Especially trigger on tasks like "review for performance," "find slow code," "make this faster," "this code is O(n²)," or when reading code that processes collections.

# dot-skills Algorithmic Complexity (Big-O) Best Practices

Find, classify, and fix algorithmic complexity (Big-O) problems in code — language-agnostic. The 39 rules across 8 categories cover the patterns responsible for the vast majority of accidental quadratic, exponential, and N+1 blowups in production code: nested iteration, loop-invariant I/O, data-structure mismatch, recursion explosions, redundant computation, collection-building anti-patterns, search/sort selection, and space traps.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing a pull request or function for performance regressions
- Asked "why is this slow?" or "can we make this faster?"
- Refactoring a hot path or a function that handles user-scaled input
- Reading code that contains: nested loops, `.includes`/`.find`/`x in list` inside iteration, ORM access in a loop, recursion without memoization, string/array building via `+=` or spread, file/database I/O inside iteration
- Reviewing code that processes lists, trees, or streams whose size will grow

## Workflow: Find, Classify, Fix

The skill is structured for a three-step workflow on any code under review:

### 1. Find — Scan for the Suspicion Patterns

Look for these structural signals first (highest hit rate):

| Signal | Likely Category | First Rule to Check |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Two nested `for` loops | `nested-` | [nested-explicit-quadratic-loops](references/nested-explicit-quadratic-loops.md) |
| `.includes` / `.find` / `x in list` inside a loop | `nested-` | [nested-includes-in-loop](references/nested-includes-in-loop.md) |
| ORM access inside a loop (`for o in orders: o.customer.x`) | `io-` | [io-n-plus-one-query](references/io-n-plus-one-query.md) |
| `await fetch` in `for-of` | `io-` | [io-sequential-await-in-loop](references/io-sequential-await-in-loop.md) |
| `array.find` to "join" two arrays | `ds-` | [ds-hashmap-for-keyed-access](references/ds-hashmap-for-keyed-access.md) |
| Recursive function with overlapping arguments | `rec-` | [rec-memoize-overlapping-subproblems](references/rec-memoize-overlapping-subproblems.md) |
| `s = s + part` or `[...acc, x]` in a loop | `build-` | [build-avoid-quadratic-string-concat](references/build-avoid-quadratic-string-concat.md), [build-avoid-spread-in-reducer](references/build-avoid-spread-in-reducer.md) |
| `sorted(...)` called inside a loop | `search-` | [search-sort-once-outside-loop](references/search-sort-once-outside-loop.md) |
| `readlines()` / loading whole files | `space-` | [space-stream-dont-load](references/space-stream-dont-load.md) |

### 2. Classify — Derive the Big-O

Compute complexity from the code structure:

| Structure | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Single loop over n items, O(1) body | O(n) |
| Two nested loops over n / m items | O(n*m) |
| Loop calling an O(n) operation (`.includes`, `.find`, `x in list`) | O(n*m), often misread as O(n) |
| Recursive `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)` without memoization | O(2ⁿ) |
| Recursive `f(n) = 2*f(n/2) + O(n)` | O(n log n) |
| Recursive `f(n) = 2*f(n/2) + O(1)` | O(n) (full tree traversal) |
| Recursive `f(n) = f(n/2) + O(1)` | O(log n) |
| `s = s + part` in a loop | O(n²) (string immutability) |
| `[...acc, x]` in a reduce | O(n²) (copy-on-spread) |
| Query/RPC inside loop over n items | O(n) round trips |

When in doubt, ask: **"As input doubles, does runtime roughly double (linear), quadruple (quadratic), or do something worse (exponential)?"** That's the practical complexity class.

### 3. Fix — Apply the Pattern From the Matching Rule

Each reference file in `references/` is a `{category}-{slug}.md` containing:
- WHY the pattern matters (the cascade effect)
- An **Incorrect** code example with the cost annotated
- A **Correct** example with the minimal diff
- When NOT to apply the fix (the rule has exceptions)

The minimal diff philosophy is intentional: the goal is for the agent to see exactly how few lines need to change to flip the complexity class.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| # | Category | Prefix | Impact | Rules |
|---|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Nested Iteration Patterns | `nested-` | CRITICAL | 6 |
| 2 | Loop-Invariant I/O and N+1 | `io-` | CRITICAL | 5 |
| 3 | Data Structure Mismatch | `ds-` | HIGH | 6 |
| 4 | Recursion Complexity | `rec-` | HIGH | 5 |
| 5 | Redundant Computation | `compute-` | MEDIUM-HIGH | 5 |
| 6 | Collection Building | `build-` | MEDIUM | 4 |
| 7 | Search & Sort Selection | `search-` | MEDIUM | 4 |
| 8 | Space Complexity Traps | `space-` | LOW-MEDIUM | 4 |

## How to Use

1. Start with the **Find** signal table above to locate the most likely pattern.
2. Open the matching reference file for the WHY and the minimal-diff fix.
3. If you're classifying complexity from scratch, use the **Classify** table to derive Big-O from code structure.
4. When proposing a fix, quote the rule by file path so reviewers can verify the reasoning.
5. See [`references/_sections.md`](references/_sections.md) for category ordering rationale, and [`assets/templates/_template.md`](assets/templates/_template.md) when adding new rules.
