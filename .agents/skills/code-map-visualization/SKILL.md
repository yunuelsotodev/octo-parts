description: Rendering and perception layer for codebase-as-geohash-map visualisations — choosing what to encode on colour/size/position, picking perceptually honest colour scales (viridis/OKLCH, not rainbow), drawing tens of thousands of cells on Canvas2D + WebGL/deck.gl inside a 16ms frame budget, placing and decluttering labels, GPU or spatial-index picking, camera animation and level-of-detail crossfades, and keyboard plus screen-reader accessibility for the canvas. Sits on top of geohash-spatial-code-maps, which owns the geohash encoding, projection, tiling, and navigation math. Also covers nature-inspired rendering — Voronoi, circle packing, phyllotaxis, metaball hulls, edge bundling. Trigger even when the user does not say "visualisation" — if the work involves drawing, colouring, labelling, animating, or making navigable a code map, spatial heatmap, or large cell/point layer on the web, this is the skill.

# Code Map Visualization Best Practices

How to render and visually navigate a codebase that has been projected and geohashed into a 2D map — making it honest, fast, legible, interactive, animated, and accessible. This is the rendering and perception craft on top of the spatial structure: it draws on decades of information-visualisation, cartography, computer-graphics, and nature-/biology-inspired layout knowledge so a code map reads correctly and runs at interactive rates. Contains 47 rules across 9 categories, prioritised by impact.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Deciding what code attribute to put on which visual channel (position, size, colour) and which colour scale tells the truth
- Drawing tens of thousands to millions of cells on the web with Canvas2D, WebGL, or deck.gl, and keeping the render loop inside the frame budget
- Placing and decluttering region/file labels, and rendering legible text over a busy map
- Wiring up interaction — hover, picking, selection, a camera/view-state model, deep links, keyboard control
- Animating camera moves, level-of-detail transitions, and data updates without disorienting the viewer
- Making the canvas accessible to color-vision-deficient, motion-sensitive, keyboard-only, and screen-reader users

## A note on scope

This skill is the **rendering and perception layer**. The companion skill `geohash-spatial-code-maps` owns the **spatial math** — geohash encoding, the code→plane projection, bbox/covering-set queries, tiling, and the precision↔zoom navigation model. Rules here cross-link into that skill (e.g. [`map-deterministic-projection`](../geohash-spatial-code-maps/references/map-deterministic-projection.md), [`nav-level-of-detail-aggregation`](../geohash-spatial-code-maps/references/nav-level-of-detail-aggregation.md)) rather than re-deriving it. Examples target TypeScript with Canvas2D + WebGL/deck.gl and d3-scale/d3-color; the perceptual reasoning generalises to any rendering stack.

## How to Use

Read individual reference files for detailed explanations, code examples, and "when NOT to apply" guidance:

- [Section definitions](references/_sections.md) — Category structure and impact levels
- [Rule template](assets/templates/_template.md) — Template for adding new rules

Rules cross-link via `[[other-rule-slug]]`; follow them when a related pattern is referenced. Cross-links to `enc-`, `prec-`, `dec-`, `qry-`, `nbr-`, `idx-`, `map-`, and `nav-` rules point into the companion `geohash-spatial-code-maps` skill — read them there for the spatial math.

To build a renderer end to end, the spine is: decide the encoding (category 1) → choose colour (category 2) → stand up the GPU pipeline (category 3) → hold the frame budget (category 4) → add labels, interaction, animation, and accessibility (categories 5–8); reach for organic, cell-based rendering — Voronoi regions, packing, membranes, edge bundling — when it suits the map (category 9). The upstream projection and tiling come from `geohash-spatial-code-maps`.
