description: Mapping out an unfamiliar codebase via NLP and graph algorithms — 40 algorithms across topic modelling, semantic embeddings, code graphs, repository mining, clone detection, IR-based bug localization, identifier linguistics, and complexity metrics. Trigger when hunting bugs across many files, scoping a new feature, identifying domain entities, or analyzing commit history — even if the user doesn't explicitly mention algorithms — apply when they ask "where does X live in this codebase?", "what is this codebase about?", "find duplicated logic", "what changed recently?", "who owns this code?", or "is this function risky?".

# pproenca Linguistic and Semantic Algorithms Best Practices

Reference of 40 algorithms an agent should reach for when extracting structure, meaning, history, or risk signals from source code and commit data. Categories are ordered by **insight-per-effort** — how much non-obvious truth the technique exposes relative to how easy it is to apply. The first two categories target the highest-leverage questions: *what business entities live in this code?* and *where else does this concept already exist?* — questions that grep and intuition cannot answer.

## When to Apply

Reach for these algorithms when:

- **Orienting in an unfamiliar codebase**: PageRank the import graph to find the core, run LDA over identifier tokens to discover business themes, mine change coupling to surface hidden architectural couplings.
- **Hunting a bug from a description**: BM25 + history prior + embedding re-rank produces a ranked file shortlist far better than grep.
- **Scoping a feature**: find prior PRs that did similar work via embedding similarity; map the feature's vocabulary against the codebase's domain via TF-IDF and noun-phrase mining.
- **Reviewing a refactor**: AST-level GumTree diff reveals semantic impact text diff hides; PDG isomorphism finds the "same logic, different code" twin you should also update.
- **Auditing risk**: hotspots (churn × complexity), bus factor, defect-magnet density, dead-code candidates — together they direct attention to the parts of the codebase that pay back attention.
- **Identifying domain entities and bounded contexts**: noun-phrase mining + TF-IDF rare-term extraction + Louvain communities + Jensen-Shannon divergence on per-cluster vocabulary.

## How to Use

Pick the category that matches the user's question, then read one or two specific rules from that category. Most rules cite combinable partners ("Combine with `mine-change-coupling`...") that compound the signal — read the partner rule when you need higher precision.

For unfamiliar repos, the highest-ROI starting sequence is:
1. `graph-pagerank-core` → read the top-20 most central files
2. `concept-lda-topic-modeling` + `concept-tfidf-rare-terms` → identify the business themes
3. `mine-hotspots-churn-complexity` → find where the bugs concentrate
4. `mine-change-coupling` → uncover hidden architectural couplings

For a single-task bug or feature, the pipeline is:
1. `local-bm25-saturation` (broad candidates) → `local-embedding-bug-text` (semantic re-rank) → `local-history-prior-localization` (fix-history boost)
2. `sim-cross-pr-feature-mapping` for prior precedent on new features
3. `mine-change-coupling` to surface partner files that historically move together

Always preprocess identifier tokens via `ling-camel-snake-split` → `ling-abbreviation-expansion` → `ling-porter-stemming` before any vocabulary-based algorithm. Skipping this step silently degrades every downstream signal.

**Cross-language parsing.** Most rule code examples use Python's built-in `ast` module for brevity. For real cross-language work (Go, Rust, Java, TS, C++ in the same repo), use [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) — it provides robust parsers for 40+ languages with a uniform API. Every AST-based rule in this skill (PDG clones, GumTree, Zhang-Shasha, POS-tag heads, identifier co-occurrence) maps cleanly onto tree-sitter ASTs.
