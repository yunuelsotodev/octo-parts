description: Choosing or implementing an algorithm or data structure — asymptotic complexity, data-structure selection, sorting & searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, divide & conquer, greedy algorithms, string/sequence algorithms, and the at-scale toolbox (Bloom filters, HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, reservoir sampling, consistent hashing, external merge sort, Aho-Corasick, MinHash/LSH). Trigger on tasks involving "what's the right algorithm for…", performance-critical code, code with nested loops over the same input, recursive solutions, shortest-path / scheduling / matching / DP problems, code review for accidental O(n²) blowup, and any "how do I do X at scale / on a stream / without enough RAM" question — even if the user doesn't explicitly mention "algorithm" or "complexity."

# Community Classical Computer Science Algorithms Best Practices

A practitioner-oriented reference for choosing and implementing classical algorithms and data structures correctly. Organized by execution-lifecycle impact: the earliest decisions (asymptotic class, data-structure choice) cascade through everything else, so the rules near the top of the table matter most.

**Scope:** the patterns that show up in everyday production code review, reasonable interview / contest problems, **and the at-scale toolbox** (sketches, streaming, distributed primitives) — not an exhaustive cover of CLRS. Topics intentionally outside the current version: network flow, modular arithmetic, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall as standalone rules, SCC (Tarjan/Kosaraju), computational geometry, FFT, Manacher / Z-function as standalone rules. They're flagged inline in the relevant rules.

Distilled from CLRS (*Introduction to Algorithms*, 4th ed.), Sedgewick & Wayne (*Algorithms*, 4th ed., Princeton), Skiena's *Algorithm Design Manual*, Laaksonen's *Competitive Programmer's Handbook*, [cp-algorithms.com](https://cp-algorithms.com/), and the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide).

## When to Apply

Use these rules when:

- Choosing an algorithm or data structure for a new problem ("what's the right way to do X?")
- Reviewing code for hidden O(n²) blowup — repeated `in`-checks on lists, `pop(0)` on lists, string concatenation in loops, naive substring search
- Picking a DP state or recurrence, before writing the memoization
- Modeling a problem as a graph (BFS vs Dijkstra vs topological sort)
- Refactoring brute force / naive solutions that work on toy inputs but time out at scale
- Deciding whether greedy applies, or whether DP / branch-and-bound is required

## Rule Categories By Priority

| # | Category | Prefix | Impact | Why it cascades |
|---|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Asymptotic Complexity & Algorithm Selection | `comp-` | CRITICAL | Wrong O() class makes every other optimization irrelevant |
| 2 | Data Structure Selection | `ds-` | CRITICAL | The container determines which operations are cheap |
| 3 | Sorting & Searching | `srch-` | HIGH | Foundation for greedy, two-pointer, sweep-line, binary-search-on-the-answer |
| 4 | Dynamic Programming | `dp-` | HIGH | Exponential → polynomial transformations |
| 5 | Graph Algorithms | `graph-` | HIGH | Networks, dependencies, routing, scheduling all reduce to graphs |
| 6 | Divide & Conquer / Recursion | `divide-` | MEDIUM-HIGH | Logarithmic-factor speedups; stack-depth and recurrence traps |
| 7 | Greedy Algorithms | `greedy-` | MEDIUM | Fast when correct, silently wrong when not |
| 8 | String & Sequence Algorithms | `str-` | MEDIUM | Pattern matching, parsing, substring queries |
| 9 | Scale & Probabilistic Algorithms | `scale-` | MEDIUM | Sketches, streaming, distributed primitives — situational, decisive when they apply |

## How to Use

Start with the category that matches the question:

- **"What's the right algorithm for n = 10⁶?"** → `comp-` (input-bound)
- **"I'm looking things up in a list inside a loop"** → `ds-hash-map-for-keyed-lookup` or `comp-watch-for-quadratic-blowup-from-membership-in-list`
- **"My recursion is slow"** → `dp-memoize-overlapping-subproblems` and `comp-derive-recurrences-via-master-theorem`
- **"Shortest path / connectivity / ordering tasks"** → `graph-`
- **"Choose items to maximize value"** → start with `greedy-prove-exchange-argument-before-using`; fall back to `dp-knapsack-pattern`
- **"Find / match strings"** → `str-`
- **"Memory is the constraint, not time"** / **"Sample / count / deduplicate at scale"** / **"Sharding"** → `scale-`

Code examples are in Python (most readable across audiences). The reasoning generalizes to any language — equivalent stdlib primitives are listed where they differ.
