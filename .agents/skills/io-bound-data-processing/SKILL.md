description: Processing, transforming, or moving datasets that may exceed RAM on a single low-compute box — covers memory discipline (streaming, generators, dtype shrinkage), I/O access patterns (sequential vs random, mmap, async), data formats (Parquet vs CSV vs JSON, predicate pushdown), chunking & batching, spill-to-disk (external merge sort, DuckDB/Polars), pipelining (bounded queues, backpressure, checkpointing), codec selection (zstd/lz4/gzip), concurrency for I/O-bound workloads (asyncio, threads, prefetch), and observability (iowait vs CPU%, rows/sec, py-spy/strace). Trigger on "process a large file", "stream this", "out-of-core", "OOM kill", "this is slow", or code with `pd.read_csv` of multi-GB files, `requests.get(...).content` on big bodies, `BytesIO` on unbounded inputs, per-row INSERTs, sequential `requests.get` loops, falling `tqdm` rates — even if I/O or memory isn't mentioned. Complement to computer-science-algorithms.

# Community I/O-bound data processing on constrained resources Best Practices

A reference for engineers processing datasets larger than RAM on a single low-compute box. Organized by execution-lifecycle impact: rules near the top of the table govern *whether the job runs at all*; rules near the bottom shave the last 10 %. Optimize from the top of the waterfall.

**Scope:** the patterns that show up in real ETL / data-engineering / batch work on a laptop, a 2-vCPU container, or a Raspberry Pi-class node — streaming, formats, chunking, spill, backpressure, codecs, and the concurrency model that actually matches an I/O-bound bottleneck. Out of scope (covered elsewhere): the algorithmic primitives themselves (see [`computer-science-algorithms`](../computer-science-algorithms/)), distributed compute beyond a single box (use Spark/Dask), and database-engine internals (see official docs).

Distilled from [Apache Arrow / Parquet docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/), [Polars User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/), [DuckDB docs](https://duckdb.org/docs/), [pandas — Scaling to large datasets](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/scale.html), Linux man pages ([mmap(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html), [sendfile(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html), [posix_fadvise(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/posix_fadvise.2.html)), Brendan Gregg's [USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) and *Systems Performance*, Kleppmann's [*Designing Data-Intensive Applications*](https://dataintensive.net/), and the [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) / [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) reference benchmarks.

## When to Apply

Reach for these rules when:

- A job OOM-kills, swaps, or runs much slower than expected on a small box
- Input is *larger* than RAM and you need to scan, filter, aggregate, sort, or join it
- A pipeline has unbounded buffers between stages, or memory grows linearly during a "streaming" job
- You see one-row-per-RTT writes (`INSERT` per row, `requests.get` per URL, `f.read(32)` per record)
- You're picking a format/codec/serializer and the choice matters at scale
- A `top` shows low CPU and high iowait, or you don't know which it is
- "It's slow but I don't know why" — start at the obs- category

## Rule Categories By Priority

| # | Category | Prefix | Impact | Why it cascades |
|---|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Memory Discipline | `mem-` | CRITICAL | Slurping into RAM defeats every downstream technique on a constrained box |
| 2 | I/O Access Patterns | `io-` | CRITICAL | Disk/net are 10³–10⁶× slower than RAM; access pattern dominates wall-clock |
| 3 | Data Format & Encoding | `fmt-` | HIGH | Format fixes the lower bound on I/O volume + decode cost before any logic runs |
| 4 | Chunking & Batching | `batch-` | HIGH | Granularity controls peak memory and amortizes per-item overhead |
| 5 | Spill-to-Disk & External Memory | `spill-` | HIGH | When data > RAM, the choice is "spill cleanly" or "OOM" |
| 6 | Pipelining & Backpressure | `pipe-` | MEDIUM-HIGH | Unbounded buffers between fast producers and slow sinks = OOM |
| 7 | Compression & Serialization | `codec-` | MEDIUM | Trades CPU for I/O; right codec saves orders of magnitude |
| 8 | Concurrency for I/O-Bound Workloads | `conc-` | MEDIUM | Async / threads / processes are different tools; wrong model wastes CPU |
| 9 | Observability & Throughput Tuning | `obs-` | LOW-MEDIUM | Can't tune what you don't measure; iowait ≠ CPU-bound |

## How to Use

Start with the question that matches the problem:

- **"It OOMs / RAM grows linearly during a streaming job"** → `mem-` and `pipe-` (likely an unbounded buffer or per-iteration accumulation)
- **"Disk is 100 % busy but CPU is idle"** → `io-` (likely random access, unbuffered I/O, or wrong format)
- **"Why is reading this 10 GB file so slow?"** → start with `fmt-columnar-for-analytical-scans` and `io-buffer-explicitly-for-small-records`
- **"How big should the chunk be?"** → [`batch-pick-chunk-size-by-memory-budget`](references/batch-pick-chunk-size-by-memory-budget.md)
- **"Data doesn't fit in RAM"** → `spill-` (and prefer an engine that does it for you: [`spill-use-engines-that-spill-automatically`](references/spill-use-engines-that-spill-automatically.md))
- **"Lots of small network calls"** → [`io-batch-and-pipeline-network-roundtrips`](references/io-batch-and-pipeline-network-roundtrips.md), [`io-async-for-many-concurrent-streams`](references/io-async-for-many-concurrent-streams.md)
- **"Adding workers didn't help"** → [`conc-tune-parallelism-to-the-bottleneck`](references/conc-tune-parallelism-to-the-bottleneck.md), [`obs-measure-iowait-not-just-cpu`](references/obs-measure-iowait-not-just-cpu.md)
- **"It's slow but I don't know why"** → `obs-` first; profile before changing anything

Code examples are in Python (most readable across audiences). The reasoning generalizes — equivalent libraries in other ecosystems (Arrow C++/Rust/Java, Polars Rust, DuckDB everywhere, libuv-style async) follow the same patterns.
