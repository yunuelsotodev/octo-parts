description: Designing CLIs that AI agents will invoke — non-interactive flags, layered --help with examples, stdin/pipeline composition, actionable errors, idempotency, dry-run, destructive-action safety, and predictable command structure. Use when designing, building, or reviewing a command-line tool that AI agents or automation will invoke. Trigger even if the user doesn't explicitly say "agent-friendly" — apply whenever they are writing `--help` text, adding a new subcommand, designing error messages, or reviewing a CLI's UX.

# Agent-Friendly CLI Design Best Practices

Prescriptive design and review standards for Command-Line Interface Design targeting AI agents and scripts, not just humans typing at a prompt. Human-oriented CLIs often block agents: interactive prompts, huge upfront docs, help text without copy-pasteable examples, error messages without fixes, no dry-run mode. This skill prioritizes rules by blast radius — from "the agent cannot use this CLI at all" (CRITICAL) to "the agent has to read help one extra time" (MEDIUM).

Use this skill both when **building** a new CLI and when **reviewing** an existing one for agent-friendliness.

This skill contains **45 rules across 8 categories**.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing `--help` text for any subcommand
- Designing new flags, arguments, or subcommands
- Crafting error messages or exit codes
- Adding destructive operations that need dry-run or confirmation
- Choosing between interactive prompts and flag-only inputs
- Shaping success output so agents can chain commands
- Reviewing an existing CLI for headless-usability regressions

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Non-interactive Operation | CRITICAL | `interact-` |
| 2 | Help Text Design | HIGH | `help-` |
| 3 | Error Messages | HIGH | `err-` |
| 4 | Destructive Action Safety | HIGH | `safe-` |
| 5 | Input Handling | HIGH | `input-` |
| 6 | Output Format | MEDIUM-HIGH | `output-` |
| 7 | Idempotency & Retries | MEDIUM-HIGH | `idem-` |
| 8 | Command Structure | MEDIUM | `struct-` |

Note: `help-examples-in-help` is rated CRITICAL within the HIGH `help-` category because its specific failure — help text without examples — makes every other help rule moot. The category label reflects the average, not the worst case.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Non-interactive Operation (CRITICAL)

- [`interact-flags-first`](references/interact-flags-first.md) — Express every input as a flag first; prompts are TTY-only fallback

- [`safe-crash-only-recovery`](references/safe-crash-only-recovery.md) — Design multi-step commands for crash-only recovery

### 5. Input Handling (HIGH)

- [`input-accept-stdin-dash`](references/input-accept-stdin-dash.md) — Accept `-` as filename for stdin and stdout
- [`input-flags-over-positional`](references/input-flags-over-positional.md) — Prefer named flags over positional arguments

## How to Use

### When building a new CLI

Start at CRITICAL and walk down. The first two categories (`interact-` and `help-`) are non-negotiable — if any rule in these is violated, the CLI is unusable by agents regardless of how good the rest is. After those, work through `err-`, `safe-`, and `input-` — these are where most real-world friction lives. `output-`, `idem-`, and `struct-` are polish that compounds across many invocations.

### When reviewing an existing CLI

Run through this checklist in priority order:

1. **Non-interactive path** — invoke every subcommand with `--no-input` or under `</dev/null` and see which hang
2. **Layered help** — does `mycli --help` list subcommands only, or dump everything?
3. **Examples on `--help`** — every subcommand's help should end with a runnable Examples section
4. **Error messages with invocations** — does every error tell the caller exactly which flag to add?
5. **stdin/pipeline story** — can you pipe output into input? Does `-` mean stdin?
6. **Exit codes** — are usage errors (2), runtime failures (1), and transient failures (69) distinct?
7. **Dry-run** — every destructive command has `--dry-run` (or equivalent)
8. **Confirmation bypass** — every destructive command has `--yes`/`--force`
9. **Consistent command structure** — do `service list`, `deploy list`, `config list` all exist and work the same way?
10. **Structured success output** — does `deploy` return a `deploy_id` the agent can use next?
