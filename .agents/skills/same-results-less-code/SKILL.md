description: Same behaviour in fewer, clearer lines — covers the judgment gaps that linters cannot catch (reinvention, wrong frame, hidden duplication, derived state, procedural rebuilds, speculative generality, defensive excess, type-system underuse). Trigger when reviewing, refactoring, or simplifying code — and even when the user doesn't explicitly ask for "simplification" but is reviewing code, refactoring, or asking "is there a shorter way to write this?". Complements knip/eslint/ruff/tsc by focusing on the conceptual modelling layer those tools cannot see.

# Community Refactoring Best Practices: Same Results, Less Code

Code-review and refactoring guide focused on the parts of code volume that come from **judgment and modelling gaps** — wrong abstraction choices, hidden semantic duplication, defensive habits, premature generality. This skill deliberately skips what linters and tools like `knip`, `eslint`, `ruff`, `tsc --noUnusedLocals`, or formatters already catch. It is the second pass: after the mechanical cleanup, what remains?

## Core Principles

1. **Preserve behaviour.** Every transformation must produce identical observable behaviour — same outputs, same errors, same side effects, same API surface.
2. **Earlier mistakes cascade.** A wrong frame multiplies into wrong shapes, which multiply into duplicate logic. Optimise from the top of the lifecycle.
3. **Explain why, not just what.** Each rule explains the cost of the anti-pattern so judgment can transfer to novel cases.
4. **Quantify where possible.** Prefer "eliminates N lines / prevents X bug class" over "cleaner."
5. **Don't over-refactor.** Rule of three: extract abstractions when duplication has actually appeared three times, not in anticipation.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing a PR for "could this be simpler?" (the question linters can't answer)
- Refactoring code that has grown in volume without growing in capability
- Auditing a module that "feels heavy" — many flags, many layers, many checks
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase and trying to spot the parts that are accidental volume vs essential complexity
- Designing a new module and wanting to avoid the common over-abstraction traps
- Working alongside knip / eslint / ruff and wanting the layer of judgment those tools can't supply

**Don't use this skill for:**

- Mechanical cleanup that a linter or formatter already does (unused imports, dead exports, style) — use `knip`, `eslint`, `ruff`, or `prettier`/`black` instead.
- Algorithmic complexity / performance tuning — use [`complexity-optimizer`](../complexity-optimizer/) for that.
- General cleanup of recently modified code regardless of mental-model gaps — use [`code-simplifier`](../../.curated/code-simplifier/).

| 3 | Hidden Duplication | `dup-` | HIGH | 5 | Semantic copies hiding behind syntactic differences |
| 4 | Derived State Stored | `derive-` | HIGH | 5 | Storing what should be computed |
| 5 | Procedural Rebuilds | `proc-` | MEDIUM-HIGH | 5 | Imperative reimplementation of declarative concepts |
| 6 | Speculative Generality | `spec-` | MEDIUM | 5 | Generality built for a second user who never arrived |
| 7 | Defensive Excess | `defense-` | MEDIUM | 4 | Checks for states the type/flow already rules out |
| 8 | Type System Underuse | `types-` | LOW-MEDIUM | 6 | Runtime guards that should be types |

## How to Apply (Workflow)

When asked to review or refactor code with this skill:

1. **Run the mechanical pass first.** `knip`/`eslint`/`ruff`/`tsc --noUnusedLocals` will catch dead code, unused imports, style. Don't duplicate that work here.
2. **Read the file or PR for *intent*.** Ask: what is this code trying to do? The judgment skill is recognising when the implementation overshoots the intent.
3. **Walk the categories in priority order.**
   - Start with [Reinvention](references/reinvent-stdlib-collection-ops.md) and [Frame](references/frame-function-not-class.md) — the biggest wins live there.
   - Then [Duplication](references/dup-parallel-types-same-shape.md) and [Derived state](references/derive-dont-store-computed.md).
   - Then [Procedural rebuilds](references/proc-loop-to-collection-method.md) and [Speculative generality](references/spec-interface-of-one.md).
   - Defensive and type-system issues last — they're high frequency but localised.
4. **Propose minimal-diff transformations.** Each rule shows incorrect → correct as a tight diff; preserve that property in suggestions.
5. **Verify behaviour.** Outputs, errors, and side effects must be identical. Tests must still pass.
6. **Don't bundle unrelated changes.** Each transformation should map to one category. Mixing them makes the change hard to review.

## When NOT to Apply

- Code is younger than the rule of three (one or two duplicates) — extracting is premature.
- The pattern is genuinely a known exception (see each rule's "When NOT to use this pattern" section).
- The refactor would be a large, risky rewrite without a clear test safety net — propose, don't execute.
- Performance-critical hot paths where the "simpler" form has measurable cost — measure first.
