name: opencode-ts
description: Write and refactor TypeScript code in repos that use Effect-TS services, Effect Schema, event-sourced persistence, and barrel-module architecture. Use this skill when implementing features, fixing bugs, writing tests, or refactoring in opencode or any TypeScript codebase built on the same stack (Effect DI via Context.Service, Drizzle ORM, Hono routes, Bun runtime). Triggers on tasks involving Effect services, Context.Service / Layer modules, Effect Schema definitions, SyncEvent patterns, tool implementations, test writing, or code review in Effect-based TypeScript projects.

# Opencode TypeScript

Code like the opencode core team. This skill contains real code extracted from the repo — complete implementations, not abstract rules. Follow the workflow below based on your task.

---

## Implement (new code)

Follow these phases in order:

### 1. Orient — where does this go?

Load [architecture.md](references/architecture.md). Find:
- Which module owns this behavior
- What the dependency direction allows
- What file naming convention to follow
- Whether this is a new module or an addition to an existing one

### 2. Gather — what already exists?

Load [helpers-deep-dive.md](references/helpers-deep-dive.md). Before writing ANY utility:
- Check if it already exists in `util/`, `effect/`, `bus/`, `sync/`
- Check the usage matrix to see how other modules use it
- If it exists, use it. If it doesn't, inline first — extract only when awkwardness repeats.

For quick lookups: [primitives.md](references/primitives.md) (shorter, import paths + signatures only)

### 3. Build — write the code

Load the reference that matches what you're building:

| Building... | Load this |
|---|---|
| Service module (namespace + Effect service + schemas + events) | [service-module.md](references/service-module.md) |
| Tool or modifying tool behavior | [tool-module.md](references/tool-module.md) |
| Database tables, schemas, events, error types | [schemas-and-state.md](references/schemas-and-state.md) |
| Server routes, config, plugins, project lifecycle | [server-and-routes.md](references/server-and-routes.md) |
| Tests | [test-writing.md](references/test-writing.md) |

### 4. CHECK GATE — code MUST pass all of these before proceeding

Load [style-dna.md](references/style-dna.md). **If ANY of the following fail, fix the code before proceeding to Review:**

- [ ] Single-word variable names where clear
- [ ] No `try`/`catch`, no `else`, no `any`, no unnecessary destructuring
- [ ] `const` + ternary over `let` + mutation
- [ ] snake_case Drizzle fields, `.annotate({ identifier })` on boundary schemas, `.annotate({ description })` on fields
- [ ] Effect Schema (`Schema.Struct`/`Schema.Schema.Type`) for DTOs, events, tool params — not Zod
- [ ] Effect is used for services, not plain async classes
- [ ] Module ends with `export * as X from "."` — no in-file `export namespace X {}`
- [ ] No patterns from Section 7 ("Things That Compile But Get Rejected") present in the diff

**DO NOT proceed if any check fails.** Go back to phase 3 and fix.

### 5. REVIEW GATE — REJECT the diff if any of these apply

Load [review-voice.md](references/review-voice.md). **The diff MUST NOT contain any of the following. If it does, fix before submitting:**

- [ ] Changes to files outside the scope of the task
- [ ] `as any` or `as unknown as` casts
- [ ] Custom utilities that duplicate community primitives or `@/util/*` helpers
- [ ] Provider-specific code that should live in models.dev
- [ ] Code removal without a clear reason documented in the commit
- [ ] Unexplained variable renames or structural changes
- [ ] Abstraction the core team would ask to remove (check refactoring-patterns.md)

---

## Refactor (changing existing code)

### 1. Orient — what touches what?

Load [architecture.md](references/architecture.md). Map the blast radius before changing anything.

### 2. Study — which pattern applies here?

Load [refactoring-patterns.md](references/refactoring-patterns.md). **Start with the Decision Matrix at the top** — match the code smell you see to the correct pattern. Then read the specific pattern section for real before/after diffs:
- Simplification patterns (removing unnecessary abstraction)
- Consolidation patterns (Bun → Node migration)
- Extraction patterns (pulling reusable utilities)
- Migration patterns (moving to Effect services)
- Deletion patterns (removing dead code)
- Stabilization patterns (fixing ordering/race conditions)
- Variant elimination (removing special cases)

### 3. Gather — can an existing utility replace this code?

Load [helpers-deep-dive.md](references/helpers-deep-dive.md). The best refactor often replaces 20 lines with one utility call.

### 4. Check + Review

Same as implement phases 4-5: [style-dna.md](references/style-dna.md) then [review-voice.md](references/review-voice.md).

## Key decisions (always apply)

- **Effect is mandatory** — all services use `Context.Service` / `Layer` / `makeRuntime`. No plain async classes.
- **One module, one self-barrel** — write flat top-level exports (schemas, `Interface`, `Service`, `layer`, `defaultLayer`), then close the file with `export * as X from "."`. Consumers still write `import { X } from "@/x"` → `X.Service`; the barrel *is* the namespace. opencode dropped in-file `export namespace X {}`.
- **Effect Schema everywhere** — `Schema.Struct` + `Schema.Schema.Type<typeof X>` for DTOs, events, and tool params; `.annotate({ identifier })` on boundary schemas, `.annotate({ description })` on fields. `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` for Effect errors. `Newtype<Self>()("Name", Schema.String.check(...))` (from `@opencode-ai/core/schema`) for branded IDs. Zod is no longer the boundary tool.
- **Event-sourced writes** — mutations go through `SyncEvent.run` → projectors → SQLite. Direct DB writes only for non-event-sourced features.
- **No mocks in tests** — use `tmpdir` + `Instance.provide` + real services. Mocks only for external SDKs.
- **Single-word variables** — `state`, `pending`, `info`, `row`, `cfg`, `tx`. Multi-word only when genuinely ambiguous.
