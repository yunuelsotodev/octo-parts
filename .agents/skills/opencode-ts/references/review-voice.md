# PR Review Voice -- What Gets Pushed Back On and Why

Source: actual PR review comments from `sst/opencode` core maintainers.

Reviewers studied:
- **thdxr** (Dax Raad) -- top contributor, 1949 commits. Repo owner. Reviews naming, consistency, architecture.
- **adamdotdevin** (Adam) -- second contributor, 1848 commits. Reviews UI/app code, package scope, existing library reuse.
- **kitlangton** -- core contributor. Reviews Effect-TS patterns, type safety, code correctness, naming in services.
- **rekram1-node** -- core contributor. Reviews provider code, API correctness, docs, scope creep from external PRs.

---

## 1. Naming Consistency

The codebase enforces a strict naming convention. If you use `projectId` instead of `projectID`, it gets called out.

### thdxr on PR #15120 -- camelCase convention for IDs

> "stupid nit but we use `projectID` everywhere"

```diff
+export type Workspace = {
+  id: string
+  branch: string | null
+  projectId: string        // <-- WRONG: should be projectID
```

**Rule**: ID suffixes are always uppercase: `projectID`, `sessionID`, `messageID`. Never `projectId`, `sessionId`.

**REJECT IF:** Any new or modified variable, field, parameter, or type uses camelCase ID suffix (`projectId`, `sessionId`, `messageId`) instead of uppercase (`projectID`, `sessionID`, `messageID`).

### kitlangton on PR #19150 -- naming local state

> "We usually call this `state` (not `cache`)"

**Rule**: Follow the codebase's existing vocabulary. If every service calls its internal store `state`, do not invent `cache`.

**REJECT IF:** A new variable introduces a synonym for an established codebase term. Common violations: `cache` instead of `state`, `config` instead of `cfg` (for locals), `directory` instead of `dir`, `existingClient` instead of `existing`.

### AGENTS.md style guide -- single-word names

The style guide is explicit:

> "Use single word names by default for new locals, params, and helper functions."
> "Good short names to prefer: `pid`, `cfg`, `err`, `opts`, `dir`, `root`, `child`, `state`, `timeout`."
> "Examples to avoid unless truly required: `inputPID`, `existingClient`, `connectTimeout`, `workerPath`."

---

## 2. Do Not Touch Unrelated Code

External PRs that change files beyond their stated scope get pushed back immediately.

### adamdotdevin on PR #15863 -- unrelated package modifications

> "pedantic, but let's leave this untouched"

(on changes to `packages/opencode/src/session/processor.ts`)

> "again, pedantic, but would prefer this package not touched at all"

(on changes to `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts`)

**Rule**: If your PR is about the UI, do not touch session processing code. If your PR fixes a bug, do not refactor adjacent code. Stay in scope.

**REJECT IF:** The diff modifies files in directories unrelated to the stated task. A bug fix touching formatting in adjacent files, or a UI change touching `session/`, `tool/`, or `provider/` code.

### rekram1-node on PR #14586 -- unrelated reformatting

> "why change this unrelated stuff?"

```diff
-    if (model.api.npm === "@ai-sdk/anthropic") {
+    if (model.api.npm === "@ai-sdk/anthropic" || model.api.npm === "@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock") {
```

The contributor also refactored surrounding code (restructuring an `if` chain, changing variable names). The reviewer wanted only the one-line fix plus its test:

> "why can't we just have this change +1 test for it, ill cleanup later cause we should be a bit better at doing this across the board but there was a special case that caused errors in the past"

**Rule**: Minimal diffs. One change per PR. Do not refactor while fixing.

**REJECT IF:** The diff includes formatting changes, variable renames, import reordering, or structural refactoring that is not directly required by the stated change.

---

## 3. No Type Casts (`as any`)

Type casts are rejected immediately with no discussion.

### kitlangton on PR #16956 -- `as any` in import command

> "no! bad robot."

```diff
-              data: msg.info,
+              data: msg.info as any,
```

And again on the same PR:

> "no casts"

```diff
-              data: part,
+              data: part as any,
```

**Rule**: If the types do not align, fix the types. Never cast to `any`. The AGENTS.md is explicit: "Avoid using the `any` type."

**REJECT IF:** The diff contains `as any`, `as unknown as`, or any type assertion that masks a type error instead of fixing it. Zero tolerance — no exceptions.

---

## 4. Use Existing Libraries, Do Not Reinvent

### adamdotdevin on PR #15863 -- custom hooks vs community primitives

> "let's swap this out with https://primitives.solidjs.community/package/resize-observer/#createelementsize (i think we already have this package installed and some usage of it)"

(on a custom `use-element-height.ts` hook)

> "let's swap this out with https://primitives.solidjs.community/package/page-visibility/#usepagevisibility"

(on a custom `use-page-visible.ts` hook)

> "could replace this with https://primitives.solidjs.community/package/media/#createmediaquery"

(on a custom `use-reduced-motion.ts` hook)

**Rule**: Before writing a custom utility, check if a community primitive already exists. The project uses `@solid-primitives/*` heavily. Do not add custom hooks that duplicate them.

**REJECT IF:** A new `use-*.ts` hook or utility function duplicates functionality available in `@solid-primitives/*`, `@opencode-ai/core/*` (framework-agnostic utilities like `util/log`, `util/wildcard`), `@/util/*` (app-only utilities like `@/util/media`), or `@/effect/*`. Check before writing.

---

## 5. Do Not Add Custom Provider Logic -- Use models.dev

External contributors frequently try to add provider-specific code directly into the codebase. This is always rejected.

### rekram1-node on PR #14104 -- hardcoding provider in source

> "If you want to add a new provider, please make a PR to models.dev (see how all other providers work)"

```diff
+    // Add IONOS AI Model Hub provider if not already in models.dev
+    if (!database["ionos"]) {
+      const ionosAPI = {
+        npm: "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
+        url: "https://openai.inference.de-txl.ionos.com/v1",
+      }
```

### rekram1-node on PR #13991 -- provider not in models.dev

> "hm I dont see this provider in models.dev?"

### rekram1-node on PR #14052 -- redundant config

> "this already comes from models.dev"

### rekram1-node on PR #13765 -- dynamic model fetching not needed

> "do we need this? If the models are in models.dev ... Note that Im adding the dynamic model fetching this week for all the primary providers, I dont think we need this one..."

> "Believe this is in models.dev"

> "I think models.dev handles this now"

**Rule**: Provider definitions, model lists, API URLs, and env var names all live in `models.dev`. Do not duplicate them in the opencode source. Make a PR to models.dev instead.

**REJECT IF:** The diff adds hardcoded provider-specific data (model IDs, API URLs, environment variable names, model capabilities) that should live in `models.dev`. This is the single most common rejection reason for external PRs.

---

## 6. Do Not Promote Third-Party Services as "Recommended"

### rekram1-node on PR #13765 -- provider promotion rejected (5 separate comments)

> "don't want to add as recommended provider"

(on adding Kilo to the recommended provider list in the auth command)

> "don't want to add as recommended provider"

(on adding Kilo to the CLI auth flow sort order)

> "We don't want to add this as a recommended provider."

(on adding Kilo to the TUI provider dialog)

**Rule**: The recommended provider list is curated. External providers should work through `models.dev` and the generic auth flow. Do not add promotional copy, special sort order, or recommendation badges for third-party services.

**REJECT IF:** The diff adds a provider to the recommended list, changes provider sort order, or adds promotional language for any third-party service.

---

## 7. Question Why Code Was Removed

### adamdotdevin on PR #7130 -- safety guard removed

> "why remove this? this was added because of conflicts between the terminal component and the prompt input, does removing it not cause any issues there?"

```diff
   const handlePaste = async (event: ClipboardEvent) => {
-    if (!isFocused()) return
```

### kitlangton on PR #18433 -- accidental deletion of `result.push`

> "Looks like this may have been accidentally deleted? Unless I'm missing something :)"

```diff
-        result.push(msg)
```

> "Do you need to push the message still?"

**Rule**: When you remove code, the reviewer will ask why. Have a reason. If you are refactoring, make sure you are not silently dropping logic.

**REJECT IF:** The diff deletes logic (guard clauses, error handlers, function calls, return statements) without a comment or commit message explaining why the code is safe to remove.

---

## 8. Question Unexplained Changes

### kitlangton on PR #16948 -- unexplained variable rename

> "??? why the change from input -> config?"

```diff
-      projectID: input.projectID,
+      projectID: config.projectID,
```

### kitlangton on PR #16948 -- unnecessary type alias

> "why the alias????"

```diff
+import type { WorkspaceInfo as WorkspaceInfoType } from "./types"
```

### kitlangton on PR #16948 -- unexplained structural change

> "???? why this?"

```diff
-      const row = { ...Session.toRow(exportData.info), project_id: Instance.project.id }
+      const row = {
+        ...Session.toRow({ ...exportData.info, projectID: Instance.project.id }),
+        project_id: Instance.project.id,
+      }
```

### kitlangton on PR #16948 -- type change without explanation

> "Wat?"

```diff
-            info: Session.Info
+            info: SDKSession
```

**Rule**: Every change in a PR must have a clear reason. If the reviewer cannot understand why a line changed from reading the diff, the PR will be blocked with "???" until explained.

**REJECT IF:** The diff contains variable renames, type alias changes, structural reorganization, or any modification where the "why" is not obvious from context. If you cannot explain the change in one sentence, it needs a comment.

---

## 9. Correctness Over Cleverness

### rekram1-node on PR #14283 -- logic that cannot work

> "U removed the 4.6 cases like opus-4.6 and sonnet-4.6, so isAnthropicAdaptive will never be true for the vercel ai gateway provider"

> "This will not work"

### rekram1-node on PR #17053 -- wrong system prompt logic

> "WRONG"

(single word, on incorrect agent permission wiring in the system prompt)

### kitlangton on PR #16948 -- wrong assertion

> "Shouldn't this compare against Project.global?"

```diff
-        expect(Instance.project.id).not.toBe("global")
+        expect(String(Instance.project.id)).not.toBe("global")
```

**Rule**: Reviewers will test your logic mentally. If a condition can never be true, or a comparison does not test what it claims to test, it will be caught.

**REJECT IF:** A conditional checks a state that cannot occur (removed enum value, impossible type, completed migration), OR an assertion/comparison tests the wrong value (e.g., comparing `String(id)` instead of comparing against the correct constant).

---

## 10. Effect-TS Patterns

### kitlangton on PR #17961 -- follow existing patterns for global services

> "Look at `opencode/packages/opencode/src/account/effect.ts` and `account/index.ts`. I forgot this was a requirement for these global services."

### kitlangton on PR #18971 -- use the Effect service, not raw calls

> "I think Auth has been Effectified so we can depend on and use that service."

> "Should use the `config` helper above?"

### kitlangton on PR #15487 -- extract magic numbers

> "extract the magic number 1 here. it's used a few places."

```ts
const current = (db: DbClient) => {
  const state = db.select().from(AccountStateTable).where(eq(AccountStateTable.id, 1)).get()
```

### kitlangton on PR #15487 -- question data model design

> "the active_account_id + selected_org_id thing is a bit weird. why not just put the selected org id on the account state too? so that's the selector. I know we forget the last selected org per account... but does that matter? maybe?"

### kitlangton on PR #15487 -- no hardcoded defaults for services in development

> "I don't think we want a default at this time."

```ts
const serverDefault = "https://web-14275-d60e67f5-pyqs0590.onporter.run"
```

**Rule**: Effect services follow a specific pattern in this codebase. Look at existing services (`account/effect.ts`, `account/index.ts`) before writing new ones. Use `Effect.cached` for deduplication. Use existing Effect services rather than raw calls.

**REJECT IF:** A new service doesn't follow the service pattern (Interface → `Context.Service` → Layer (+ `defaultLayer`) → optional `makeRuntime` facade). The `makeRuntime` + async facade is only added where imperative (non-Effect) callers exist; pure Effect-land services (Question, Permission) skip it and are consumed via `yield* X.Service`. Also reject if code uses raw `await` calls to a module that already has an Effect Service (use `yield* ServiceName` instead).

---

## 11. Testing Patterns

### kitlangton on PR #18433 -- unnecessary Promise.all

> "I don't think these need to be wrapped in Promise.all :)"

```diff
-    expect(MessageV2.toModelMessages(input, model)).toStrictEqual([
+    expect(await Promise.all([MessageV2.toModelMessages(input, model)])).toStrictEqual([
```

Preferred:

> "`expect(await MessageV2.toModelMessages(input, model)).toStrictEqual([` should be fine"

### rekram1-node on PR #14586 -- suspicious test changes

> "hm im not sure if this one is correct"

(on a test that was restructured but the reviewer suspected the new assertions did not match the original intent)

### rekram1-node on PR #16069 -- flaky test workaround

> "flaky!"

```diff
+  // powershell + windows just isnt that fast... we need to wait
+  await page.waitForTimeout(3_000)
```

**Rule from AGENTS.md**: "Avoid mocks as much as possible. Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests."

**REJECT IF:** Tests wrap non-promises in `Promise.all`, use `jest.mock()`/`vi.mock()` for modules that can be tested with real services via `Instance.provide`, or add `waitForTimeout()` as a flaky-test workaround instead of fixing the underlying timing issue.

---

## 12. UI Code -- Use Correct Variants and Patterns

### adamdotdevin on PR #8513 -- wrong button variant

> "Should be `ghost` I think"

(on a Button component using `variant: "secondary"` instead of `variant: "ghost"`)

### adamdotdevin on PR #10651 -- use focus-visible, not focus

> "Why not just change this to focus-visible?"

```diff
       &:hover:not(:disabled),
-      &:focus:not(:disabled),
```

### adamdotdevin on PR #8513 -- duplicate CORS middleware

> "Why add this and not remove the one below? Only need it once, just moved up here right?"

### adamdotdevin on PR #8513 -- batch state updates

> "Minor, but could do a single setStore for each of these here"

(on multiple individual `setStore()` calls that could be batched)

**Rule**: Know the UI component library. Use the right variant (`ghost` vs `secondary`). Use `focus-visible` not `focus` for keyboard-only focus styles. Batch SolidJS store updates.

**REJECT IF:** A component uses the wrong variant (check existing usage of the same component type for the correct variant), uses `:focus` pseudo-class instead of `:focus-visible`, or makes multiple individual `setStore()` calls that could be batched into a single update.

---

## 13. Platform and Cross-Platform Concerns

### rekram1-node on PR #13992 -- use EOL for cross-platform newlines

> "u should use EOL instead"

```diff
-      process.stderr.write(`Exporting session: ${sessionID ?? "latest"}`)
+      process.stderr.write(`Exporting session: ${sessionID ?? "latest"}\n`)
```

### rekram1-node on PR #18900 -- null byte splitting for file paths

> "Should we do what zed does and split on null bytes instead? Can't this break if file names have tabs in them?"

### rekram1-node on PR #14166 -- base64 content size calculation

> "I think they will always be base64 right"

> "If files content is base64, does this actually calculate the size correctly?"

**Rule**: Think about Windows. Think about encoding. Think about file paths with special characters.

**REJECT IF:** The diff uses hardcoded `"\n"` for line endings instead of `os.EOL`, splits file paths on tabs (use null bytes like Zed does), or calculates byte sizes from base64 strings without accounting for encoding overhead.

---

## 14. Scope Discipline for CLI and Console Output

### rekram1-node on PR #13571 -- use the project's UI, not console

> "prolly shouldnt use console here, should use UI consistent w/ other commands."

```diff
+      } catch {
+        console.error(`Session not found: ${args.sessionID}`)
```

**Rule**: CLI output should go through the project's output utilities (prompts, formatters), not raw `console.error`. Stay consistent with how other commands display errors.

**REJECT IF:** A CLI command handler uses `console.log`, `console.error`, or `process.stderr.write` directly instead of the project's formatting utilities. Check how neighboring commands in the same file output their messages.

---

## 15. Documentation Precision

### rekram1-node on PR #14313 -- vague claims in docs

> "what is this common pattern u are referring to?"

```markdown
+Prefer unique names unless you intentionally want to replace a built-in tool. A common pattern is to create `safe_bash` and disable `bash` using [permissions](/docs/permissions).
```

### rekram1-node on PR #14313 -- scope creep in descriptions

> Prolly change:
> "the custom tool takes precedence for that session."
> TO
> "the custom tool takes precedence."

**Rule**: Docs must be precise. Do not claim something is a "common pattern" without evidence. Do not add unnecessary qualifiers that imply temporary behavior when it is permanent.

**REJECT IF:** Documentation claims something is "common", "typical", or "recommended" without a concrete example or link. Also reject scope-narrowing qualifiers like "for that session" when the behavior is permanent.

---

## The Unwritten Rules (Inferred from Review Patterns)

1. **Minimal diffs win.** The smaller the PR, the faster it merges. Multi-concern PRs get each concern questioned separately.

2. **The codebase has a vocabulary.** Learn it. `state` not `cache`. `projectID` not `projectId`. `dir` not `directory`. `cfg` not `config` for locals.

3. **External contributors get the most scrutiny on scope.** If you are not a core maintainer, keep your PR to exactly one thing.

4. **"WRONG" is a valid review comment.** Core maintainers are blunt. Do not take it personally. Fix it and move on.

5. **Questions are blockers.** When a reviewer writes "???" or "why this?", the PR will not merge until answered. These are not rhetorical.

6. **Existing patterns are law.** Before writing new code, find an existing example in the codebase and follow its structure exactly.

7. **models.dev is the source of truth for providers.** This is the single most common rejection reason for external PRs.

8. **Effect-TS services have a specific wiring pattern.** Look at `account/effect.ts` and `account/index.ts` before creating new services.

9. **The AGENTS.md style guide is enforced.** Single-word names, no destructuring, no `else`, `const` over `let`, early returns, no mocks in tests.

10. **UI changes need to use the right primitives.** SolidJS community primitives, correct component variants, `focus-visible` over `focus`, batched store updates.
