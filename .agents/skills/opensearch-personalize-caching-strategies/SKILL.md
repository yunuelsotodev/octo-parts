description: Caching strategies in front of AWS OpenSearch (Elasticsearch) or AWS Personalize — search, recommenders, multi-recommender pages, anon vs logged-in traffic. Covers ROI decision (TPS/minProvisionedTPS, Zipf, amplification), key design (canonicalisation, cohort vs user, solution-version pinning, bucketing), personalisation boundary (anon/logged split, fan-out coalescing), strategies (cache-aside, refresh-ahead, write-through, batch precompute, L1+L2), TTL (volatility, soft/hard, jitter, event-driven invalidation), stampede protection (single-flight, XFetch, stale-while-revalidate, circuit breaker), observability (hit-rate, cost-per-1k, cardinality drift, log-replay), defensive caching (negative, Bloom filter), and tier composition (LRU, ElastiCache Redis, CloudFront, OpenSearch request/filter cache). Triggers on cache hit rate, Personalize throttling, stampede, single-flight, L1/L2, ElastiCache sizing. Complements opensearch-function-scoring-algorithms.

# Marketplace-Research OpenSearch + Personalize Caching Best Practices

A reference distillation of caching strategies for two-sided marketplaces running AWS OpenSearch (search) and AWS Personalize (recommendations behind a microservice). Contains **52 rules across 9 categories**, ordered by cascade effect — from the upstream decision of *whether* to cache, through key design, personalisation boundary, strategy selection, TTL design, stampede protection, observability, and the lower-cascade categories of negative caching and tier composition. Each rule explains the WHY (the cost, latency, or correctness mechanism), shows incorrect-vs-correct code (TypeScript/Node for the microservice layer, Python for batch and analytics, OpenSearch JSON for OS-specific queries, YAML for CDN/Kubernetes), and cites the canonical source — AWS Personalize/OpenSearch/ElastiCache documentation, the XFetch paper (Vattani et al. VLDB 2015), RFC 5861 (stale-while-revalidate), and the engineering blogs of cache infrastructure teams (Netflix EVCache, Pinterest Cachelib, Twitter Twemcache, Cloudflare).

This is the **complement** to [`opensearch-function-scoring-algorithms`](../opensearch-function-scoring-algorithms/) — that skill answers "what should the ranking compute?", this skill answers "how do you scale it to production traffic without burning down OpenSearch or Personalize?"

## When to Apply

Reach for this skill when:

- Adding caching to a search or recommendation surface for the first time — start with [decide-cache-roi-calculation](references/decide-cache-roi-calculation.md) and [decide-hot-key-distribution](references/decide-hot-key-distribution.md)
- A homepage or category page renders 5+ recommenders and Personalize bills are growing faster than traffic — [decide-amplification-multiplier](references/decide-amplification-multiplier.md), [pers-recommender-fan-out-coalescing](references/pers-recommender-fan-out-coalescing.md), [pers-cohort-precomputation](references/pers-cohort-precomputation.md)
- Cache hit rate is suspiciously low (under 30-40%) and you don't know why — [key-canonicalize-query](references/key-canonicalize-query.md), [key-strip-volatile-params](references/key-strip-volatile-params.md), [key-bucket-numerical-ranges](references/key-bucket-numerical-ranges.md), [obs-key-cardinality-tracking](references/obs-key-cardinality-tracking.md)
- Personalize is throttling (HTTP 429) during traffic spikes — [decide-personalize-quota-budget](references/decide-personalize-quota-budget.md), [neg-cache-throttled-personalize](references/neg-cache-throttled-personalize.md), [stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error](references/stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error.md)
- p99 spikes at TTL boundaries — [stamp-coalesce-concurrent-misses](references/stamp-coalesce-concurrent-misses.md), [stamp-probabilistic-early-expiration](references/stamp-probabilistic-early-expiration.md), [stamp-serve-stale-on-rebuild](references/stamp-serve-stale-on-rebuild.md), [ttl-soft-and-hard](references/ttl-soft-and-hard.md), [ttl-jitter-to-prevent-thundering](references/ttl-jitter-to-prevent-thundering.md)
- Recommendations stay stale after a model retrain — [key-version-the-model](references/key-version-the-model.md), [ttl-personalize-solution-version](references/ttl-personalize-solution-version.md), [strat-async-warm-up](references/strat-async-warm-up.md)
- A read-after-write surface shows stale data (user favourites, saved searches) — [strat-write-through-mutations](references/strat-write-through-mutations.md), [ttl-event-driven-invalidation](references/ttl-event-driven-invalidation.md)
- Cache decisions need to be defensible to finance — [decide-cache-roi-calculation](references/decide-cache-roi-calculation.md), [obs-cost-attribution](references/obs-cost-attribution.md), [obs-cache-simulation-from-logs](references/obs-cache-simulation-from-logs.md)
- Anonymous and logged-in traffic mix on the same routes — [pers-anonymous-vs-logged-split](references/pers-anonymous-vs-logged-split.md), [tier-cdn-for-anonymous](references/tier-cdn-for-anonymous.md)
- Cache is at memory pressure and you need to know whether to upsize, shorten TTL, or change strategy — [decide-hot-key-distribution](references/decide-hot-key-distribution.md), [tier-l2-elasticache-redis](references/tier-l2-elasticache-redis.md), [obs-cache-simulation-from-logs](references/obs-cache-simulation-from-logs.md)
- OpenSearch CPU is high on common queries — [tier-opensearch-request-cache](references/tier-opensearch-request-cache.md), [tier-opensearch-filter-context](references/tier-opensearch-filter-context.md), [neg-cache-empty-results](references/neg-cache-empty-results.md)
- A traffic spike from a viral link or crawler is hammering the origin — [neg-bloom-filter-against-misses](references/neg-bloom-filter-against-misses.md), [neg-cache-empty-results](references/neg-cache-empty-results.md), [stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error](references/stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error.md)

The rules apply to any AWS-based marketplace with OpenSearch and Personalize fronted by an application microservice, regardless of vertical — accommodation, food delivery, fashion, services, jobs, secondhand goods, real estate. Triggers include "cache hit rate", "cache miss storm", "Personalize throttling", "Personalize cost", "multi-recommender page", "cohort caching", "single-flight", "stale-while-revalidate", "XFetch", "OpenSearch slow queries", "ElastiCache sizing", "CloudFront search caching", "Bloom filter cache penetration", and "thundering herd".

## The Caching Pipeline

Categories are derived from the request-time caching pipeline. Earlier stages cascade: a wrong "should we cache?" decision wastes everything below; un-canonicalised keys cap hit rate at a fraction of the achievable ceiling; without observability you can't tell whether any of the rules helped.

```text
Request → [1] Decide → [2] Key construction → [3] Personalisation boundary
        → [4] Strategy (read/write path) → [5] TTL/freshness → [6] Stampede protection
        → [8] Negative/defensive → [9] Tier composition (L1/L2/CDN/OS-internal) → Response
                                                ↑
                                [7] Observability (meta-layer applied to all stages:
                                    hit rate by key class, latency-with-and-without,
                                    cost-per-1k, cardinality, staleness, log-replay)
```

## How to Use

For a focused question ("should I cache this?", "why is my hit rate low?", "how do I survive Personalize throttling?"), jump directly to the relevant rule — each is self-contained with the WHY, code, and citation.

For a full caching-design review of a new or struggling surface, work the categories top-to-bottom. The cascade is real: a wrong [decide-cache-roi-calculation](references/decide-cache-roi-calculation.md) wastes engineering effort on a cache that doesn't pay; a leaky [key-canonicalize-query](references/key-canonicalize-query.md) caps the achievable hit rate; a missing [pers-cohort-precomputation](references/pers-cohort-precomputation.md) keeps Personalize bills proportional to MAU. Stampede and observability are mandatory once hit rate exceeds 90% — the 10% miss in a thundering herd kills the origin, and without per-class hit-rate dashboards you can't tell.

**For tuning an existing cache empirically**, start with [obs-cache-simulation-from-logs](references/obs-cache-simulation-from-logs.md) (replay your logs through what-if configs) and pair with [obs-hit-rate-by-key-class](references/obs-hit-rate-by-key-class.md), [obs-cost-attribution](references/obs-cost-attribution.md), and [obs-stale-served-ratio](references/obs-stale-served-ratio.md) for the dashboards. The trio answers: is the cache doing its job, what does it cost, and are users seeing stale data?

**For the multi-recommender homepage problem specifically** (the most common Personalize cost-explosion pattern), the priority order is: [decide-amplification-multiplier](references/decide-amplification-multiplier.md) → [pers-cohort-precomputation](references/pers-cohort-precomputation.md) → [pers-recommender-fan-out-coalescing](references/pers-recommender-fan-out-coalescing.md) → [pers-anonymous-vs-logged-split](references/pers-anonymous-vs-logged-split.md). These four typically cut Personalize spend by 70-90% on consumer marketplaces.

**For the "Personalize is throttling under load" incident**, the priority is: [stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error](references/stamp-circuit-breaker-on-origin-error.md) → [neg-cache-throttled-personalize](references/neg-cache-throttled-personalize.md) → [decide-personalize-quota-budget](references/decide-personalize-quota-budget.md). The first two stabilise the user-facing impact; the third right-sizes minProvisionedTPS so it doesn't happen again.

**For sibling-skill cross-reference**, see [`opensearch-function-scoring-algorithms`](../opensearch-function-scoring-algorithms/) — that skill covers what to compute in OpenSearch (function_score, kNN, RRF, rank_feature, decay, LTR, MMR, evaluation). This skill covers how to cache it so the cluster survives production traffic.
