Distilled from the Apple Style Guide (June 2025): voice and tone (active voice, present tense, second person, no jargon), punctuation, capitalization, hyphenation rules for compound modifiers, when to spell out numbers, units of measure, UI vocabulary (button vs control vs sheet vs popover), Apple product and feature naming, technical notation for developer docs, and international style for localization. Trigger when writing, editing, or reviewing copy — even if the user doesn't explicitly mention \"style guide\" or \"copywriting,\" any time the deliverable is human-readable text the rules here apply. Especially valuable when the user is writing instructions, naming UI elements, or deciding how to format a number, date, or unit."

# Human Copywrite

Editorial style and usage guidance distilled from the Apple Style Guide (June 2025). Use it whenever you're producing text a human will read.

## When to Apply

Trigger this skill whenever the output is text a human will read. Specifically:

- **UI strings & error messages** — button labels, dialog text, empty states, onboarding copy. Voice and UI-vocabulary rules apply.
- **User-facing documentation** — help articles, READMEs, onboarding guides, tutorials. All rules apply.
- **Developer documentation** — API references, SDK guides, code comments meant for humans. Add the technical-notation rules.
- **Marketing copy** — feature announcements, landing pages, release notes. Voice, capitalization, and product-name rules are load-bearing.
- **Localized content** — anything that will be translated. The international-style rules become primary.
- **Writing about Apple platforms** — even if the surrounding product isn't an Apple product, refer to Apple hardware/software by Apple's preferred forms (iPhone, iPad, macOS, App Store).

If the user is writing code with no user-facing strings, skip this skill. If they're writing a function name or variable, that's not copywriting — that's naming, which lives elsewhere.

## Core Principles

These run through every section. When in doubt, fall back on them.

1. **Active voice, present tense, second person.** *You can connect your iPhone to a Mac.* Not *Your iPhone may be connected to a Mac.*
2. **Specific over generic.** *Choose File > Save.* Not *Use the menu to save the file.*
3. **Plain words over jargon.** *Turn on* over *activate*. *Log in* over *authenticate* (unless authenticate is technically precise).
4. **Don't make the product the subject of an action the user takes.** *You can create a database with FileMaker Pro.* Not *FileMaker Pro allows you to create a database.*
5. **Items *appear* on screen — they don't *display*.** *The setup assistant appears.* Not *The setup assistant is displayed.*
6. **Don't restate what code does — say *why*.** Applies to code comments.
7. **Respect product names verbatim.** AirPods (not Airpods), iCloud (not iCloud+ unless you mean the paid tier), Apple Pencil (not the Apple pencil).
8. **Numbers ≥10 stay digits; <10 spell out** — but with many exceptions ([numbers-and-dates.md](references/numbers-and-dates.md)).
9. **Compound modifiers preceding a noun are hyphenated; following the verb they're not** — *user-friendly app*, *the app is user friendly*.
10. **In code, never use a function name as a verb.** *Run `ls` on both directories* — not *`ls` both directories*.

For a single term ("How do I write *backup* vs *back up*?"), open [references/a-z-lookup.md](references/a-z-lookup.md) and follow the pointer to the topic file with that entry.

## Gotchas

See [gotchas.md](gotchas.md). One scope note worth knowing up front: the source's "Writing inclusively" chapter (pronouns, person-first vs identity-first language, replacements for *blacklist/whitelist* and *master/slave*) was intentionally excluded from this skill at ingest time.
