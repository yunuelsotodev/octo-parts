description: Search and recommendation system planning for a two-sided trust marketplace built on OpenSearch — user-intent framing, product-surface architecture, index design, query understanding, retrieval strategy, ranking, search-plus-recs blending, measurement, and a dashboard-and-alerting layer for ongoing decision making. Triggers on tasks involving marketplace search, homefeeds, ranking, relevance tuning, OpenSearch query DSL, analyzers, synonyms, golden sets, NDCG, A/B testing, or diagnosing an existing retrieval system. Use this skill BEFORE marketplace-personalisation when planning new work; hand off when the diagnosed bottleneck is personalisation-specific.

# Marketplace Engineering Two-Sided Search and Recsys Planning Best Practices

Comprehensive planning, design and diagnostic guide for search and recommendation systems
in two-sided trust marketplaces. Covers OpenSearch index, query and ranking patterns, the
methodology for planning retrieval work, the handoff points to recommendation-specific
tooling, and the instrumentation and dashboard layer that turns measurement into ongoing
decision making. Contains 57 rules across 10 categories ordered by cascade impact, plus
two playbooks (plan a new system from scratch, diagnose an existing one) and explicit
living-artefact conventions (decisions log, golden set, gotchas).

## When to Apply

Reference this skill when:

- Planning a new marketplace retrieval project from scratch
- Reviewing an existing retrieval system that feels stale, unfair, or unpersonalised
- Designing the OpenSearch index mapping, analyzers, or query DSL
- Choosing retrieval primitives per product surface (search, recs, hybrid, curated)
- Deciding which search quality metrics to track and dashboard
- Running the weekly search-quality review ritual
- Diagnosing a silent regression in ranking, coverage, or zero-result rate
- Deciding when a retrieval problem is actually a personalisation problem

This skill is the **precursor** to `marketplace-personalisation`. Start here for
planning and search work; hand off to the personalisation skill when the diagnosed
bottleneck is impression tracking, feedback-loop bias, or AWS Personalize-specific
design.

## Living Context

This skill treats the system as evolving. Three living artefacts carry context across
sessions, releases, and team changes — read them before making suggestions, update them
after every shipped change:

- **`gotchas.md`** (in this skill folder) — append-only diagnostic lessons. Every gotcha
  has a date and a short description of what surprised the team and how it was resolved.
- **Decisions log** (maintained in the product repo, typically `decisions/*.md`) —
  every ranking change, schema tweak, and synonym edit recorded with its hypothesis,
  offline and online evidence, ship criterion, outcome, and rollback path. See rule
  [`plan-maintain-a-decisions-log`](references/plan-maintain-a-decisions-log.md).
- **Golden query set** (frozen per eval cycle, committed to the product repo) — the
  reference set of queries against which every ranking change is offline-evaluated
  before an online test. See rule
  [`plan-version-the-golden-set`](references/plan-version-the-golden-set.md).

## Rule Categories

Categories are ordered by cascade impact on the retrieval lifecycle: intent
misunderstanding poisons architecture; wrong architecture poisons index; wrong index
poisons retrieval forever until a reindex; every downstream layer inherits the upstream
error.

|---|----------|--------|--------|

| 2 | Surface Taxonomy and Architecture | `arch-` | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Index Design and Mapping | `index-` | HIGH |
| 4 | Planning and Improvement Methodology | `plan-` | HIGH |
| 5 | Query Understanding | `query-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 6 | Retrieval Strategy | `retrieve-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 7 | Relevance and Ranking | `rank-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 8 | Search and Recommender Blending | `blend-` | MEDIUM |

## Planning and Improving

Two playbooks compose the rules into end-to-end workflows:

- [`references/playbooks/planning.md`](references/playbooks/planning.md) — Plan a new marketplace retrieval system from scratch. Nine-step workflow from intent audit through the first A/B-tested online lift, with explicit exit criteria per step.
- [`references/playbooks/improving.md`](references/playbooks/improving.md) — Diagnose and improve an existing retrieval system. Decision tree that walks through telemetry, index freshness, coverage, baseline gap, cold start, segment regressions, and algorithm iteration in that order, with hand-off points to `marketplace-personalisation` when the bottleneck is personalisation-specific.

Read the playbooks first when the task is "design a new search and recommender project"
or "this retrieval system needs to get better". Read individual rules when a specific
question arises during implementation or review.

## How to Use

- Read [`references/_sections.md`](references/_sections.md) for category structure and cascade rationale.
- Read [`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md) for diagnostic lessons accumulated from prior incidents.
- Read [`references/playbooks/planning.md`](references/playbooks/planning.md) to plan a new system.
- Read [`references/playbooks/improving.md`](references/playbooks/improving.md) to diagnose an existing one.
- Read individual rule files when a specific task matches the rule title.
- Use [`assets/templates/_template.md`](assets/templates/_template.md) to author new rules as the skill grows.
