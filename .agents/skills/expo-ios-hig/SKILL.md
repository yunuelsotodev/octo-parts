description: Expo / React Native iOS interface conforming to Apple Human Interface Guidelines (iOS 26) — native navigation (Expo Router native stack and tabs), platform controls (Alert, ActionSheetIOS, SF Symbols via expo-symbols), safe areas, dark mode, Dynamic Type, haptics, Liquid Glass, accessibility, and 60fps motion. Covers architecture and styling decisions made in React Native/TypeScript; for the @expo/ui SwiftUI component API use the expo-ui skill, and for native Swift use ios-hig. Trigger when building, reviewing, or refactoring such an app — even when the user does not say "HIG" or "native feel" but is writing TSX screens, navigation, lists, forms, or styling for iOS in Expo.

# Expo iOS HIG Best Practices

Design rules for building iOS 26 apps in **Expo (React Native)** that feel genuinely native under Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Contains **46 rules across 8 categories**, prioritized by how much each decision affects native feel and HIG compliance. Every example is **TSX/Expo** — the decisions you make in React Native and TypeScript, not Swift.

The core idea: a React Native app feels native when it *reaches for the platform* — the system navigation controller, system controls, semantic colors, SF Symbols, real haptics, the system share sheet — instead of re-implementing iOS in JavaScript. These rules say which decision earns the native feel and which one quietly forfeits it.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Building or reviewing iOS screens, navigation, lists, or forms in an Expo app
- Choosing navigation: Expo Router native stack vs JS stack, native tabs, sheets, modals, large titles
- Picking controls: when to use the native `Alert`, `ActionSheetIOS`, date picker, `Switch`, SF Symbols, or drop to `@expo/ui`
- Styling for the platform: safe areas, dark mode, semantic colors, the iOS type scale, spacing, Liquid Glass
- Making interaction feel native: touch targets, press feedback, swipe actions, pull-to-refresh, gestures, haptics
- Adding motion, loading/empty states, accessibility, permissions, and launch polish

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **The `@expo/ui` component API** — for how to use `@expo/ui/swift-ui` components, Host boundaries, and modifiers, use the **`expo-ui`** skill. This skill says *which decisions* make an app native and points to `@expo/ui` when dropping to SwiftUI is the right call; it does not re-document that API.
- **The cross-platform design system itself** — for the shared Unistyles theme, design tokens, variant-driven component APIs, and making components feel native on **web** as well as iOS, use the **`expo-design-system`** skill. This skill governs iOS native feel; that one governs the token and component architecture that the two frontends share.
- **Native Swift / SwiftUI** — for HIG in a native Swift codebase, use **`ios-hig`** or **`ios-design`**. This skill's examples are all React Native/TSX.
- **Android** — these rules target iOS conventions. Use platform-adaptive code so Android gets Material; don't apply iOS idioms there.

## How to Use

Read individual reference files for detailed explanations and code examples:

- [Section definitions](references/_sections.md) — Category structure and impact levels
- [Rule template](assets/templates/_template.md) — Template for adding new rules
- Reference files: `references/{prefix}-{slug}.md`

Each rule file contains a short explanation of *why* it matters for native feel, an **Incorrect** (non-native) TSX example, a **Correct** (native) example that is a minimal diff from it, and an authoritative reference URL. Where relevant, rules add a "When NOT to use this pattern" or "Alternative" section.
