description: Mapping an unfamiliar codebase into feature/business domains — answering "what is this about", "which files implement feature X", "where is the architectural spine", or reviewing a refactor that crosses module boundaries. 47 algorithms across 9 categories — graph construction (omnipresent filter, multilayer, SCC), lexical preprocessing (Samurai, TF-IDF), community detection (Leiden, Infomap, SBM, MCL, Walktrap, spectral, HDBSCAN), architecture recovery (Bunch+MQ, ACDC, Limbo, Reflexion, DSM), topic modelling (LDA, LSI, NMF, HDP), evolutionary coupling (Gall, ROSE), information-theoretic (NCD, MI, MDL, naturalness), centrality (PageRank, HITS, betweenness, TextRank), validation (MoJoFM, ARI/NMI, resolution limit, consensus, co-change prediction, ablation). Trigger without explicit "clustering" mention — codebase grokking, dependency mapping, domain extraction, architecture-recovery validation all apply.

# Community Codebase Comprehension And Domain Mapping Algorithms Best Practices

A practitioner-oriented reference of the **algorithms that work for mapping a codebase into understandable feature/business domains**. Most of these techniques live in the Software Architecture Recovery and Mining Software Repositories literatures and are invisible to working engineers — yet they're the right tools for the job a coding agent is asked to do every day: *"what does this codebase do, and where?"*

The 47 rules are organized by **execution-lifecycle impact**: a wrong decision early in the pipeline (which graph to build, which identifiers to keep) propagates through everything downstream. The three CRITICAL categories (`graph-`, `clust-`, `valid-`) are the ones a wrong call cannot be recovered from later. Read them first.

**Scope**: proven algorithms with peer-reviewed citations or canonical books — Newman *Networks*, Leskovec-Rajaraman-Ullman *Mining of Massive Datasets*, Ganter-Wille *Formal Concept Analysis*, plus 40+ ICSE / FSE / TSE / PNAS / JMLR papers. No tutorial sites, no Stack Overflow, no marketing posts. Deliberately deferred to a future version: GNN/CodeBERT/code2vec (not "proven over decades" yet) and refactoring-recipe stuff (covered by sibling skills like `react-refactor` and `typescript-refactor`).

## When to Apply

Use these rules when:

- Onboarding an agent into an unfamiliar codebase: "explain what this codebase does, by domain"
- Producing an architecture map: "what are the main subsystems and how do they connect?"
- Locating a feature: "which files implement payments / authentication / search?"
- Reviewing a refactor: "did this change respect the architectural boundaries?"
- Detecting architectural debt: "what files have surprising coupling?"
- Validating an existing decomposition: "does the README's architecture match the code?"
- Picking algorithms for any of the above — the user wants something that's *proven*, not vibes

## Rule Categories By Priority

| # | Category | Prefix | Impact | What it does |

| 5 | Software-Specific Architecture Recovery | `arch-` | HIGH | Bunch + MQ, ACDC, Limbo, Reflexion, DSM |
| 6 | Topic Modelling on Source Code | `topic-` | HIGH | LDA, LSI/SVD, NMF, HDP, coherence-based K selection |
| 7 | Evolutionary Coupling & Co-Change Mining | `evol-` | HIGH | Lift / confidence / support, large-commit filter, temporal decay, logical coupling |
| 8 | Information-Theoretic Methods | `info-` | MEDIUM-HIGH | Normalized Compression Distance, Mutual Information, MDL, code naturalness |
| 9 | Centrality, Hierarchy & Labelling | `rank-` | MEDIUM | PageRank, HITS, betweenness, TextRank/YAKE labels |

## How to Use

Start with the question the agent is trying to answer:

- **"What are the main domains in this codebase?"** → `graph-` (pick a graph) → `clust-` (Leiden / Infomap / SBM) → `topic-` (label them) → `valid-` (sanity-check stability and ablate)
- **"Which files implement feature X?"** → `topic-lda-on-source-code` for theme location; `rank-pagerank-for-module-importance` with X's files as seed for personalized PageRank
- **"Where is the architectural spine?"** → `rank-pagerank-for-module-importance` + `rank-hits-hubs-and-authorities` on the dependency graph
- **"Does the README's architecture match the code?"** → `arch-reflexion-model` is purpose-built for this
- **"What's the *real* coupling here (beyond static dependencies)?"** → `evol-logical-coupling-as-architectural-signal` and `evol-mine-cochange-with-lift-and-confidence`
- **"How do I cluster without designing features?"** → `info-normalized-compression-distance`
- **"How big are the clusters supposed to be?"** → `valid-be-aware-of-resolution-limit` and `topic-hdp-for-nonparametric-topic-count`
- **"How do I know my decomposition is right?"** → the entire `valid-` category; multi-proxy evaluation is mandatory

The skill's worldview: **build the right graph first** (and filter omnipresent files), **pick an algorithm matching the graph and the question**, **use a code-specific preprocessing pipeline** (Samurai + stop-words + stemming + TF-IDF) where lexical signals matter, and **always validate** — MoJoFM if you have expert ground truth, consensus + co-change prediction + ablation if you don't.

Code examples are in Python because the reference implementations (networkx, igraph, leidenalg, scikit-learn, gensim, graph-tool, hdbscan) all live there. The reasoning generalises to any language.
