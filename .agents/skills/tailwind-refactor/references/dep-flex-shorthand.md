## Replace flex-shrink and flex-grow with shrink and grow

The `flex-shrink-*` and `flex-grow-*` utilities were deprecated in Tailwind v3.3 in favor of the shorter `shrink-*` and `grow-*` aliases. While both forms worked in v3, Tailwind CSS v4 removes the `flex-` prefixed versions entirely. The classes are silently purged and produce no CSS output, resulting in broken layouts that are difficult to detect because the build itself succeeds without errors.

**Incorrect (what's wrong):**

```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="flex-shrink-0">Logo</div>
  <div class="flex-grow">Content</div>
  <div class="flex-shrink flex-grow-0">Sidebar</div>
</div>
```

**Correct (what's right):**

```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="shrink-0">Logo</div>
  <div class="grow">Content</div>
  <div class="shrink grow-0">Sidebar</div>
</div>
```
