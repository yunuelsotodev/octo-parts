## Never Break the System Back-Swipe Gesture

For iOS 26 / Swift 6.2 clinic architecture flows, this rule applies to coordinator-driven `NavigationStack` routes and Route Shell wiring exactly as it does to local feature screens.

The left-edge swipe to go back is muscle memory for hundreds of millions of iPhone users — breaking it feels like someone moved the light switch in your own home. The disorientation is immediate and the trust damage is lasting. This gesture will outlast any custom interaction you replace it with, because it is wired into the muscle memory of everyone who has ever used an iPhone. Respecting it is not a constraint — it is a commitment to the spatial language your users already speak fluently.

**Incorrect (custom drag gesture conflicts with system back swipe):**

```swift
struct ImageViewer: View {
    @State private var offset: CGSize = .zero

    var body: some View {
        // This DragGesture captures ALL horizontal drags,
        // including the system's edge-swipe-to-go-back
        Image("photo")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .offset(offset)
            .gesture(
                DragGesture()
                    .onChanged { value in
                        offset = value.translation
                    }
                    .onEnded { _ in
                        withAnimation(.smooth) { offset = .zero }
                    }
            )
    }
}
```

**Correct (gesture restricted to avoid edge-swipe conflict):**

```swift
struct ImageViewer: View {
    @State private var offset: CGSize = .zero
    @GestureState private var isDragging = false

    var body: some View {
        Image("photo")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .offset(offset)
            .gesture(
                DragGesture(minimumDistance: 20)
                    .updating($isDragging) { _, state, _ in
                        state = true
                    }
                    .onChanged { value in
                        // Only handle vertical drag-to-dismiss,
                        // leave horizontal edge swipes to the system
                        if abs(value.translation.height) > abs(value.translation.width) {
                            offset = CGSize(width: 0, height: value.translation.height)
                        }
                    }
                    .onEnded { value in
                        if abs(value.translation.height) > 200 {
                            dismiss()
                        } else {
                            withAnimation(.smooth) { offset = .zero }
                        }
                    }
            )
    }

    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss
}
```

**Common causes of broken swipe-back:**
| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| `TabView` with `.tabViewStyle(.page)` inside a `NavigationStack` | Place paging content in a non-navigated context, or use a custom pager that yields the leading edge |
| `.navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)` with no replacement | Always provide a custom back button **and** keep the swipe gesture via `.toolbar` placement instead |
| Custom `NavigationView` replacement (e.g., manual stack with `AnyView`) | Migrate to `NavigationStack` which handles the interactive pop transition natively |
| `DragGesture()` with no directional constraint | Constrain to vertical axis, or use `simultaneousGesture` with `.highPriorityGesture` to yield to the system |

**Alternative (custom back button without losing swipe):**

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        ContentView()
            // Hide the default back button but keep the swipe gesture
            .navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)
            .toolbar {
                ToolbarItem(placement: .navigation) {
                    Button(action: { dismiss() }) {
                        HStack(spacing: 4) {
                            Image(systemName: "chevron.left")
                            Text("Back")
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    }
}
```

**When NOT to apply:** Full-screen immersive experiences (games, camera, drawing canvases) where the entire screen is a continuous interaction surface and a back button or close gesture is more appropriate than an edge swipe.

**Reference:** [Apple HIG — Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/navigation) — "Always provide a clear path back. People usually know how they got to the current screen and expect to be able to go back."
