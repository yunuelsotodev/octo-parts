description: Personalisation and recommendation systems for a two-sided trust marketplace built on AWS Personalize — event tracking, dataset and schema design, two-sided matching, cold start, feedback loops, bias control, recipe selection, serving-time re-ranking, observability, and a diagnostic playbook for existing systems. Trigger when designing, building, debugging, reviewing, or improving such a system — and even when the user does not explicitly mention "AWS Personalize" but is working on recommendations, ranking, search, homepage personalisation, or anything that matches seekers and providers across a trust-based catalog.

# Marketplace Engineering Two-Sided Personalisation Best Practices

Comprehensive guide for designing, building and improving personalisation and recommendation
systems in two-sided trust marketplaces on AWS Personalize. Contains 49 rules across 9
categories, ordered by cascade impact on the personalisation lifecycle, plus two playbooks
for planning a new system from scratch and diagnosing an existing one.

## When to Apply

Reference this skill when:

- Designing the event schema and tracking for a new recommender system
- Choosing an AWS Personalize recipe (USER_PERSONALIZATION_v2, SIMS, PERSONALIZED_RANKING_v2)
- Writing or reviewing candidate-generation and re-ranking code for marketplace search or homefeed
- Handling cold start for new providers, new seekers, or new catalog regions
- Diagnosing a live system that "mostly works but feels stale, unfair, or unpersonalised"
- Planning the next experiment, baseline comparison, or A/B test for the recommender
- Investigating concentration, coverage collapse, death spirals, or training-serving skew
- Adding observability dashboards, drift detection, or online metric slicing

## Setup

This skill has no user-specific configuration — it is self-contained. References are live
URLs to official AWS Personalize documentation, academic papers on bias and exposure, and
engineering blogs from Airbnb and DoorDash.

## Rule Categories

Categories are ordered by cascade impact: earlier stages poison everything downstream.

| # | Category | Prefix | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Event Tracking and Capture | `track-` | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Dataset and Schema Design | `schema-` | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Two-Sided Matching Patterns | `match-` | CRITICAL |
| 4 | Simple Baselines and Theory of Constraints | `simple-` | HIGH |
| 5 | Feedback Loops and Bias Control | `loop-` | HIGH |
| 6 | Cold Start and Coverage | `cold-` | HIGH |
| 7 | Recipe and Pipeline Selection | `recipe-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 8 | Inference, Filters and Re-ranking | `infer-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 9 | Observability and Online Metrics | `obs-` | MEDIUM-HIGH |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Event Tracking and Capture (CRITICAL)

- [`track-log-impressions-alongside-clicks`](references/track-log-impressions-alongside-clicks.md) — the denominator that turns clicks into a rate and unlocks unbiased training
- [`track-use-stable-opaque-item-ids`](references/track-use-stable-opaque-item-ids.md) — prevents history loss when listings rename or move
- [`track-stamp-events-with-request-id`](references/track-stamp-events-with-request-id.md) — the join key that enables impression-to-outcome attribution
- [`track-stream-events-via-putevents`](references/track-stream-events-via-putevents.md) — real-time adaptation versus end-of-day bulk import
- [`track-capture-negative-signals`](references/track-capture-negative-signals.md) — dismissal is information, silence is not
- [`track-measure-outcomes-not-clicks`](references/track-measure-outcomes-not-clicks.md) — reward the completed booking, not the clickbait

### 2. Dataset and Schema Design (CRITICAL)

- [`schema-design-conservatively`](references/schema-design-conservatively.md) — Interactions schemas are immutable, Users/Items are painful to change

- [`simple-heuristic-rerank-cold-cohorts`](references/simple-heuristic-rerank-cold-cohorts.md) — trust × recency × proximity

### 6. Cold Start and Coverage (HIGH)

- [`cold-use-v2-recipe-with-metadata`](references/cold-use-v2-recipe-with-metadata.md) — metadata extrapolates to new listings
- [`cold-best-of-segment-popularity`](references/cold-best-of-segment-popularity.md) — segmentation beats global top-N

## Planning and Improving Recommendations

Two playbooks drive end-to-end workflows that compose the rules above:

- [`references/playbooks/planning.md`](references/playbooks/planning.md) — Plan a new recommender system from scratch: a nine-step workflow that starts with instrumentation and ends with the first A/B-tested ML lift over a popularity baseline.
- [`references/playbooks/improving.md`](references/playbooks/improving.md) — Diagnose and improve an existing recommender: a decision tree that identifies the current bottleneck (telemetry, freshness, coverage, feedback loop, algorithm) and routes to the specific rules that fix it.

Read the playbooks first when the task is "design a recommender" or "this recommender
is underperforming". Read the individual rules when a specific question arises during
implementation or review.

## How to Use

- Read [`references/_sections.md`](references/_sections.md) for category structure and impact ordering.
- Read individual rule files under `references/` when a specific rule matches the task at hand.
- Read [`references/playbooks/planning.md`](references/playbooks/planning.md) to design a new system.
- Read [`references/playbooks/improving.md`](references/playbooks/improving.md) to diagnose an existing system.
- Use [`assets/templates/_template.md`](assets/templates/_template.md) to author new rules as the skill grows.
